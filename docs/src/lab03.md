# Practical 03: HTML Forms

This week's practical activity explores some more features including those in HTML forms and intermediate CSS.
We will attempt to create a HTML form utilizing these features (minus information retrieval, this'll be covered when we go through PHP).

## Task

Create a form as close as the image given below:

Image assets are given below:

The font used to create this form is called **Urbanist**, and it can be found in Google Fonts.
Click [HERE](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Urbanist) to open the Google Fonts page showcasing the font and to get details on incorporating it into your web form.

### Some Extra Details

For **Status** under _Personal Particulars_, include the following in the drop-down list:

- Please select status (disabled, selected)
- Active
- Deferred
- Graduated
- Terminated

For **Enrolled Program** under _Academic Record_, include the following:

- Please select a program (disabled, selected)
- Foundation in Computing (FIC)
- Diploma in Information Technology (DIT)

### Form Submission

Upon selecting the `Submit` button, redirect it to a different webpage called `form-submitted.html`.
In this page, create a webpage that essentially lets the website visitor know that the details entered into the form have been successfully collected.
Include any other element/text/etc. that can be considered relevant here.

### Extra Task

Consider someone who may open your form on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet.
Web developers or designers make use of the following meta tag in the `<head>` section:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

This will set the viewport of the webpage, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

Apart from that, media queries were used to cater for different screen sizes.
Look up media queries online and try to incorporate it into your web form.
You may use your browser's inspector tool to simulate viewing the webpage from a mobile device of your own choosing.
