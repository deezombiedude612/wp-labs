Website Design Of course, this is completely optional based on what you see fit. This is just my two cents on what can constitute a good website design. Website front-end design is dependent on aesthetics; HTML and CSS has very rarely got to do with much logic implementation. In the field of human-computer interaction (HCI), you will find that there are a few key design principles one would need to adhere to an interface that is useful and aesthetically pleasing at the same time. While it is crucial to ensure that a website isn't bland, sometimes it's only right to go with simple and minimalistic designs. By default, when designing a website, one has to consider the balance between functionality and aesthetics; whether one should be prioritized solely depends on what the website is to be used for. Another thing that should be taken note of is the content density. Say, for example, you're working on a design for a website acting as an online manual. Novice users will tend to prefer a lower content density - that is, they will be more likely to prefer an interface that isn't too cluttered with information or options (so as to intimidate them, among many reasons). Such interfaces would warrant little to no effort in learning how to navigate them. Expert users will tend to prefer a higher content density - that is, with knowledge of more advanced/obscure settings and/or information, for instance, they would prefer to have an interface that can leverage as much control as possible. Such interfaces would warrant a comparably greater effort in learning how to navigate them. In many professional (and actually functional) websites, you may tend to find very consistent design elements in play that constitute a website. This can range from how each element appears, to the terminology used to convey information. By having consistency, you can reduce the amount of effort needed to learn how a website works - this can be a key factor as to whether one would be compelled to explore your website more or not. While planning the design of a webpage, some find it better to prepare mockups to visualize ideas they have in mind into something tangible and easier to formulate decisions on. In fact, this is considered protocol if this were to be done within a software development standpoint, where web designers can find themselves needing to prepare visual mockups for key stakeholders (i.e., project sponsors, project managers, etc.) to see, and hopefully accept. Press F to pay respects to those working with very picky, indecisive and/or hard-to-please clients. \ud83d\ude05 Image Source Here This is only some advice I can offer from my standpoint, but what I do not possess is the intents you may have in creating your websites. Feel free to use anything I've mentioned from here, or explore a style that you would like to emulate. I think the best thing to do would be to look around and observe other websites online, and try to pick up anything you feel is interesting or vibes well with you. At the end of it, classes on designing a website using HTML and CSS is something like an art class, but with code and computers - you can learn how to use each component based on what guides you have at your disposal, but only you can form a design that speaks to you and your target audience the most. Reference Dennis, A., Wixom, B. H. & Tegarden, D. (2020). Systems Analysis and Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML (6th Edition). Wiley. Getting Started HTML files typically have the .html extension. One can create a HTML file named index.html where index is the name designated to the page. Files with the name index are often treated as home pages in web sites. For example, when one visits TIMeS , the browser would immediately look for a file whose name is index if the name of the file is not specified. Let's just say TIMeS has a page called login.html . One may visit that page instead of index.html by specifying the filename after the URL, namely: https://times.taylors.edu.my/login.html Take Note Going forward, DO NOT name any of your project folders or files with spaces. This can inevitably complicate things when we start going through referencing files in your project directory. For example, if a web site with domain www.example.com has a file named page 1.html , the address bar in a web browser will have to interpret the link to that page as: www.example.com/page%201.html The best practice is to clump the words making up the file name together without spaces (i.e., page1.html ), or to add a hyphen - or underscore ( _ ) to separate each word (i.e., page-1.html , page_1.html ). Your HTML file should take a form like as follows: <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > <!-- To contain stylesheets and various webpage information (i.e., Tab Name) --> </ head > < body > <!-- Browser viewable content should be placed here --> </ body > </ html > Avoid Deprecated Tags! Web developers are now expected to follow the HTML 5 standard when developing webpages. With this standard comes the fact that some tags/elements/attributes which were prevalently used in prior versions of HTML should no longer be applicable - they are what we call deprecated . In most cases, CSS is strongly recommended to be used as the ultimate alternative. For instance, rather than using the <u></u> element to denote underlined text, implement CSS like as follows: <!-- In <head> section: --> < style type = \"text/css\" > . underlined { text-decoration : underline ; } </ style > <!-- In <body> section: --> < span class = \"underlined\" > Underlined text </ span > Using CSS rather than resorting to deprecated tags has its upsides. For one, you can implement one style ruling to be shared across multiple HTML elements in multiple HTML documents.

Task In the webpages you created, apply the various CSS styles you've learnt in lecture (e.g., background color, fonts, image positioning, etc.). When applying CSS to your webpages, look up some good aesthetic principles web designers or developers take when designing their websites. Try to apply those principles in your webpages wherever possible. Optional Task: CSS Responsiveness Try and implement a styling that only applies itself in mobile screens. You may look up a screen resolution for a mobile device of your choice (e.g., iPhones, tablet screens). Getting Started CSS can be applied in three different methods. The encouraged method is having your CSS in an external CSS file (i.e., external style). When referencing a CSS file, one ought to use the <link> tag within the head section of the HTML document. For example, to reference styles.css in your HTML document, the placement of your CSS <link> reference should be like as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > <!-- some head content --> < link rel = \"stylesheet\" type = \"text/css\" href = \"styles.css\" /> </ head > < body > <!-- body content here --> </ body > </ html > CSS Responsiveness CSS responsiveness typically has to do with making sure that websites can adapt to different screen resolutions from different devices. You can specify how content appears in different resolutions by using the media query tag. For example, the yellowgreen background color styling only applies to screens that are at least 768px wide: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 body { background-color : orange ; } @ media only screen and ( min-width : 768px ) { body { background-color : yellowgreen ; } } Detailed information is available in Lecture 4: HTML & CSS (Part 3). However, the concept behind it is easy to understand and should be considered if you plan to make your webpage accessible on mobile screens. Local Custom Fonts Ah, fonts. There's something about fonts that make it part of a document's or interface's aesthetic - when used right alongside complementing visual elements, you can produce an outlook that dictates a great efferevescence from how professional it looks or how creative the author's mind is. There are various methods of including different types of fonts, one of which include using one that's locally installed in your computer; another being linking to a font that's available in an online repository (e.g., Google Fonts). With regards to custom fonts stored locally on your computer though, there's something that you really, REALLY NEED to take note of. Local Custom Font Location You may be tempted to just include the font straight away like how it's plug-and-play with your other applications. For example, just by including the font inside a Fonts folder or installing it enables the font to be instantly recognized by Microsoft Word and be leveraged for use in your documents. However, while this also includes your webpages, it only works because the webpages are inside your computer. You need to be aware that the custom fonts you may have (perhaps painstakingly or jovially) installed in your computer MAY OR MAY NOT exist in other computers that don't belong to you. This can be extended to external servers where websites are deployed into. You should expect computers to have a handful of fonts that act as the bare minimum for a commonplace interface, like \"Times New Roman\", \"Courier New\", \"SimSun\", and \"Arial\". Should you want to use custom fonts, you'll need to include it in your project folder. Also.. NO, the solution is not \"Just ask the other person to install the font into their computer.\" The folder structure should be something like this if you wanted to include a custom font (this case, Roboto) locally within your project folder: project |-- css |-- styles.css |-- footer.css |-- fonts (store your custom fonts in here) |-- Roboto.ttf |-- images |-- catdog.png |-- icon.svg |-- js |-- main.js |-- index.html |-- about.html |-- error-404.html From here, you can link your font file using a relative URL easily without needing to resort to digging your C: drive or what Home directory you have in your computer just to elicit the font. Of course, if you don't link it, the font may still appear to work in your computer, but this by itself does not solve your problem with it not appearing in another computer. Make sure that in your CSS file (or wherever you're using your embedded CSS, inline CSS does not have this luxury) that's being used, you use @font-face to declare use of the font on top: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 @ font-face { font-family : \"Roboto\" ; /* in this example, the font is located in a sibling folder, so you want to exit from the `css` folder before entering the `fonts` folder */ src : url ( \"../fonts/Roboto.tff\" ); /* optional: font-weight */ } Mini-Tutorial: How to Center Images in HTML In order to center <img> tags in your webpage, you may want to consider placing them into a block container element (e.g., <div> , <section> ). Then, set the text-align CSS property of that container element to center . While text-align is seemingly meant to work only with text, it can be used to align any inline elements \u2013 this includes <img> elements.

NO, the solution is not \"Just ask the other person to install the font into their computer.\" The folder structure should be something like this if you wanted to include a custom font (this case, Roboto) locally within your project folder: project |-- css |-- styles.css |-- footer.css |-- fonts (store your custom fonts in here) |-- Roboto.ttf |-- images |-- catdog.png |-- icon.svg |-- js |-- main.js |-- index.html |-- about.html |-- error-404.html From here, you can link your font file using a relative URL easily without needing to resort to digging your C: drive or what Home directory you have in your computer just to elicit the font. Of course, if you don't link it, the font may still appear to work in your computer, but this by itself does not solve your problem with it not appearing in another computer. Make sure that in your CSS file (or wherever you're using your embedded CSS, inline CSS does not have this luxury) that's being used, you use @font-face to declare use of the font on top: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 @ font-face { font-family : \"Roboto\" ; /* in this example, the font is located in a sibling folder, so you want to exit from the `css` folder before entering the `fonts` folder */ src : url ( \"../fonts/Roboto.tff\" ); /* optional: font-weight */ }","title":"Local Custom Fonts"},{"location":"lab02/#mini-tutorial-how-to-center-images-in-html","text":"In order to center <img> tags in your webpage, you may want to consider placing them into a block container element (e.g., <div> , <section> ).

JavaScript enables users to interact with the webpage's elements (and may also consequently modify the appearance of webpages through a set of action(s)). Getting Started There are two methods of implementing JavaScript into your HTML file: embedded style 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 < html > < head > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > JavaScript Example </ title > </ head > < body > <!-- Body content --> < script > // JavaScript code here </ script > </ body > </ html > external style 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 < html > < head > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > JavaScript Example </ title > </ head > < body > <!-- Body content --> < script src = \"script_name_here.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > To implement JavaScript using embedded style, the <script></script> element should be used. Location of <script> Tags Unlike CSS, you may use them in either the <head> or <body> section, or both if necessary. The only times when order is necessary is when you require a set of script commands to run first before another set of scripts. let , const and var The ECMAScript 2015 (ECMA 6) standard introduces the let and const keywords as better alternatives to var when naming variables. let is used to declare regular variables virtually the same way as how var was the go-to for the same purpose, whilst const introduces a way to create constant variables that cannot be altered upon declaration. Going forward, let and const should be used instead of var . This is mainly due to their effects on variable declarations. Declaring var is synonymous to declaring a global variable in JavaScript that can easily be modified regardless of context (i.e., in a function vs. outside of a function). By declaring a variable using var , you can expect unwanted changes in your code (basically bugs) and problems revolving scopes (i.e., function scope and block scope). Refer to the following: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 function aRandomFunction () { var a = \"Red\" ; let b = \"Blue\" ; console . log ( a , b ); // this prints: \"Red Blue\" { // Inside a block (can be for program control statements // or practically anything that uses curly parentheses) var a = \"Green\" ; let b = \"Yellow\" ; // let's assume that variables a and b // need to take on a different value temporarily here (for reasons) console . log ( a , b ); // this prints \"Green Yellow\" } // Outside of the block now console . log ( a , b ); // this prints \"Green Blue\", // can be a HUGE problem if a needs to be kept as \"Red\" } aRandomFunction (); // statement to invoke above function By declaring variables using the let keyword, you can ensure that should they need to be temporarily reassigned a different value for only within the block context, it can be done without affecting it's original value outside of said block context. This, being a trait that exists when declaring variables in many other programming languages, is something that var fails to emulate. Within JavaScript, there exists a global context/object called window which contains a number of important preset values. Think of it as like a large drawing canvas with preset items like a house with a roof of a certain color (e.g., blue). In this instance, let's assume that this window object has one attribute called color . By declaring a variable named color using the var keyword, you're essentially going to modify the default color value, which may be potentially important and will cause quite a ton of problems if tampered illegally. You can view all the attributes/variables of concern if you type out window in the Inspector Console, or simply the following statement line in a JavaScript file: // Yep, there's a bootload of 'em! for ( let v of Object . keys ( window )) document . write ( v + \"<br>\" ); The following video also gives a good explanation behind why using var to declare variables in JavaScript can be a BAD idea. Naming Variables When naming most things, it is a popular preference to adhere to the Camel Case Naming Convention . This naming convention requires that: all letters in the first word in the name be strictly in lower case, and the first letter in each subsequent word (to be placed without spaces) in upper case Examples of such names adhering to the Camel Case Naming Convention include: ports , badgerMole , numberOfPots , timeOfDay , sensor1 The other major naming convention, being Pascal Case Naming Convention , should be reserved for naming classes and objects. This naming convention requires the first letter in ALL words in the name to be upper case, the rest of which are in lower case. We will touch classes very briefly on this in Lecture 7, but know that they are not the primary focus of this module; thus there should be nearly no reason to use this convention now for the time being. Some of you who may be familiar with Python may have already been introduced to the naming convention requiring all letters to be in lower case and underscores ( _ ) to be separate each word in the name (e.g., number_of_snakes , user_input , test_subject_1 ). This naming convention is also just as acceptable as the Camel Case Naming Convention, though from my point of view, not many use it here for JavaScript. Naming Constants Constants are typically named differently, vaguely matching the convention used to name variables in Python with regards to how words are separated with underscores. However, all letters in constants are presented in upper case (e.g., NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS , KILOMETERS_TO_MILES ). Tasks Task 1 Create a HTML webpage with an empty paragraph element and a button with the text \"Click Me!\". When the button is clicked, the paragraph element should then contain the text \"You clicked the button!\". Create JavaScript code within <script> tags inside the webpage to enable this functionality. Additional Sub-task Modify the code such that it prints \"You clicked the button!\" in a new line in the browser window after each time after the button has been clicked on. Task 2 Create a HTML webpage that displays a confirm box asking users: \"Select OK to proceed or Cancel to return.\". If the OK button is selected, display an alert box that contains the message \"You may proceed.\". If the Cancel button is selected, display an alert box that contains the message \"You have chosen to cancel.\". After either alert box is dismissed, display a message on the HTML page. Create JavaScript code within <script> tags inside the webpage to enable this functionality. Task 3 Create a HTML webpage that displays a prompt box that requests users to enter their name. Once entered, an alert box should follow up with a greeting that contains the entered name. Use a separate JavaScript file to contain the JavaScript code for this functionality. Task 4 Create an empty HTML file containing the following in the <body> section: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 < script > let a = \"red\" ; let b = \"blue\" ; /* ---- INSERT CODE HERE ---- */ /* ---- END INSERT CODE ---- */ console . log ( a ); console . log ( b ); </ script > You should now be able to view from the values of a and b being printed in the console. Within the given boundaries as stated in the above code snippet, write some extra JavaScript code that will swap the values of variables a and b. You may check your variable answers using your browser's console or insert additional lines of code to automatically print out their values. Hint Use another variable to temporarily hold one of their values during the swap process.","title":"Practical 04: Introduction to JavaScript"},{"location":"lab04/#practical-04-introduction-to-javascript","text":"In this practical, you will begin to use JavaScript in making your webpages more dynamic.

This practical activity explores program control structures that can be used to implement logic into websites. Getting Started JavaScript Program Control Structure Syntax The syntax used is applicable to many other languages, but that is not of our concern at the moment. if-else Statement Syntax (Example): if ( condition1 ) { // actions #1 } else if ( condition2 ) { // actions #2 } else { // actions otherwise } switch Statement Syntax (Example): switch ( variable ) { case 1 : // do something break ; case 2 : // do something case 3 : // do something (will carry on from Case 2 since no break statement exists) break ; default : // do something } for Loop Syntax: for ( init ; condition ; update ) { /* do something here */ } for-of Loop Syntax: for ( let iter of arr ) { /* do something here */ } while Loop Syntax: init ; while ( condition ) { /* do something here */ update ; } do-while Loop Syntax: init ; do { /* do something here */ update ; } while ( condition ); JavaScript Arrays Presently, there are two ways to declare arrays: using the array() function to contain variables using square brackets [] (I very much prefer this method) Tasks Task 1 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. Part 1: Display the numbers between 5 to 22 (inclusive of both) in ascending order using a for loop in the browser's console. Part 2: In the same HTML file, display the numbers between -14 and 7 (exclusive of both) in descending order using a for loop in the browser's console. Part 3: In the same HTML file, display the even numbers between 208 and 251 (inclusive of both) in descending order using a for loop in the browser's console. Task 2 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. Part 1: Display the numbers between -45 to -23 (inclusive of both) in descending order using a while loop in the browser's console. Part 2: In the same HTML file, display the numbers between 18 and 36 (exclusive of both) in ascending order using a while loop in the browser's console. Part 3: In the same HTML file, display the odd numbers between 208 and 251 (inclusive of both) in ascending order using a while loop in the browser's console. Task 3 Create an empty HTML file containing the following in the <body> section: < script > let num = 16 ; console . log ( \"while looping..\" ); while ( num < 15 ) { console . log ( num ); num ++ ; } console . log ( \"do-while looping..\" ); </ script > After the last line given, utilize a do-while loop to carry out the same purpose as with the given while loop (i.e., use a do-while loop to print the value of num as it increases after each loop). What is the difference between these two loops in terms of their functions? Task 4 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. Prompt users to enter a year using a prompt box. Set the default value to the current year. After entering the year, the browser window should display the Chinese zodiac animal that corresponds with the given remainder after dividing by 12: Remainder Chinese Zodiac Animal Remainder Chinese Zodiac Animal 0 Monkey 6 Tiger 1 Rooster 7 Rabbit 2 Dog 8 Dragon 3 Pig 9 Snake 4 Rat 10 Horse 5 Ox 11 Sheep Task 5 The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. A person's BMI is calculated by taking the person's weight (in kilograms) divided by the person's height squared (height in meters). Create a BMI script that takes in both a person's weight and height as values to interpret the person's BMI. The respective BMI interpretations are as follows: BMI Interpretation BMI < 18.5 Underweight 18.5 \u2264 BMI < 25.0 Normal 25.0 \u2264 BMI < 30.0 Overweight BMI \u2265 30.0 Obese Implement the written script in a separate JavaScript file separate from your HTML file. You may choose to output the result from the console or via visual elements on your webpage (i.e., print the result in the browser window as a paragraph or regular text). Task 6 Create a HTML file that uses external JavaScript to carry out the following. Create an external JavaScript file that contains an array named students which contains the following values: 'Anthony', 'Barry', 'Desmond', 'Grenda'. Print the students array in the console. Utilize a for-of loop to display the array elements in the console. Pop the last element in the students array (i.e., Grenda). Hint Use the pop() function. Append the values 'Marie' and 'Zacchaeus' to the end of the students array. Print the array again; you do not need any loop structure this time. Hint Use the push() function. Remove the first value from the students array (i.e., Anthony), and replace it with a new element 'Charlie'. Print the array again; just like last time, you do not need any loop structure here. Hint There exists a shift() function that can do one of the given requirements here. Perhaps there's also an unshift function which does the opposite as well? Activity: Bubble Sort Bubble sort is one of many types of sorting algorithms taught in data structures and algorithms courses. Watch the following video to understand the concept behind bubble sort (0:48 to 2:40). In this activity, we will be using an external JavaScript file to contain our logic and the browser's inspector console to view our outputs. Our HTML page should be as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 < html > < head > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > JavaScript Bubble Sort </ title > </ head > < body > <!-- I'm assuming the JavaScript file is named as follows and is in the same file directory as this HTML file. --> < script src = \"bubbleSort.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Let's start our JavaScript file as follows: const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); Line 2 should print out the array with its elements in the original order. Let's use bubble sort to reorder the elements in this array in ascending order. Below the given JavaScript code snippet, declare a variable called is_sorted . This variable will serve as a flag variable that will determine whether to continue running through another iteration of the bubble sort algorithm. Our implementation of the bubble sort algorithm will be encapsulated within a do-while loop like as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Using a do-while loop makes it such that we won't require is_sorted to be initialized with a value just yet. Upon completing all the necessary rounds with the bubble sort algorithm, we will print out the sorted array. An alternative to using the do-while loop in this case is a for/of loop. Within the do-while loop, we will implement another loop structure - this time, we will be using a for loop. const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length ; ++ j ) { // we start comparing elements in here } } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); The mechanism behind how the bubble sort algorithm works revolves around comparing each element against its neighboring element in the array. In this implementation, we compare to check if each element is smaller than the left neighbor. At the end of each iteration, the largest element \"bubbles\" up to the end of the unsorted portion of the array (hence, why it's called bubble sort). const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); And voila, we basically created a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. We can make a few changes to make this algorithm perform more efficiently though (in data structures and algorithms courses, the idea is to produce efficient algorithms or structures that utilize as little computer resources and/or time as possible). Modifications for Efficiency Here the do-while loop makes it such that the whole algorithm keeps iterating over the whole array to see if it is sorted. However, we have established that after each iteration, every last element in the unsorted portion of the array is considered as sorted. Therefore, we do not need each iteration to loop through to check against the sorted portion of the array. We can do this by replacing the do-while loop with another for loop with another iterator variable. After that, we can deduct the value of that iterator variable from array.length in the inner for loop (i.e., array_length - i ). In this implementation, the first iteration checks the whole array since array_length - 0 . In each subsequent iteration, i is incremented by 1, and the range checked in the inner for loop shrinks by size 1 (i.e., array_length - 1 in iteration #2, array_length - 2 in iteration #3, and so on). const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ for ( let i = 0 ; i < array . length ; ++ i ) { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length - i ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } } console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); We can also make the algorithm work such that it only proceeds if there was a swap during that iteration (i.e., is_sorted has turned false). If is_sorted remains true after that iteration, it should indicate that there is nothing else to sort in the array and it is safe to leave the array be. We do this by adding an if statement at the end of the outer for loop which breaks through that loop if is_sorted has remained true. const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ for ( let i = 0 ; i < array . length ; ++ i ) { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length - i ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } if ( is_sorted ) { break ; } } console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Randomized Array So far, we've only tested this algorithm on one type of array. We can test this using different arrays to see if it works. Here, we will implement an array of 10 randomized integers between -100 and 100. We start with an empty array and we utilize a for loop to iterate over a set number of times (i.e., ARRAY_SIZE ) to push integers of the aforementioned range. If you would like to try with a larger array size, simply modify the value of ARRAY_SIZE , but be sure to only place in positive integers or this will not work. const ARRAY_SIZE = 10 ; const array = []; for ( let i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_SIZE ; ++ i ) { array . push ( Math . floor ( Math . random () * 201 - 100 )); } console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ for ( let i = 0 ; i < array . length ; ++ i ) { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length - i ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } if ( is_sorted ) { break ; } } console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Math.random() produces a decimal value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (not inclusive). We need to expand this range to cater for all values between -100 and 100 (both inclusive), which totals up to 201 (100 -(-100) + 1). Therefore, we multiply Math.random() by 201, i.e., Math.random() * 201 . This, however, produces numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 201 (exclusive). To shift the range to be between -100 (inclusive) and 101 (exclusive), we deduct that product by 100 (i.e., Math.random() * 201 - 100 ). Still, do note that Math.random() produces decimal values, and Math.random() * 201 - 100 will give any decimal value between -100 and 100 (both inclusive). We use the Math.floor() function to take the floor boundary of the generated value in order to produce that integer. Note that we do not take the ceiling boundary of the generated value (i.e., Math.ceiling() ), as this will give values between -99 and 101 (both inclusive) instead. We also do not use regular rounding off of those decimal values (i.e., Math.round() ), as this gives values between -100 and 101 (both inclusive).","title":"Practical 05: JavaScript Program Control Structure & Arrays"},{"location":"lab05/#practical-05-javascript-program-control-structure-arrays","text":"Program control structures can be leveraged in many programming languages to enable easier implementation of tasks that require decision-making or repetition that would otherwise be tedious to incorporate.

Watch the following video to understand the concept behind bubble sort (0:48 to 2:40). In this activity, we will be using an external JavaScript file to contain our logic and the browser's inspector console to view our outputs. Our HTML page should be as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 < html > < head > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > JavaScript Bubble Sort </ title > </ head > < body > <!-- I'm assuming the JavaScript file is named as follows and is in the same file directory as this HTML file. --> < script src = \"bubbleSort.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Let's start our JavaScript file as follows: const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); Line 2 should print out the array with its elements in the original order. Let's use bubble sort to reorder the elements in this array in ascending order. Below the given JavaScript code snippet, declare a variable called is_sorted . This variable will serve as a flag variable that will determine whether to continue running through another iteration of the bubble sort algorithm. Our implementation of the bubble sort algorithm will be encapsulated within a do-while loop like as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Using a do-while loop makes it such that we won't require is_sorted to be initialized with a value just yet. Upon completing all the necessary rounds with the bubble sort algorithm, we will print out the sorted array. An alternative to using the do-while loop in this case is a for/of loop. Within the do-while loop, we will implement another loop structure - this time, we will be using a for loop. const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length ; ++ j ) { // we start comparing elements in here } } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); The mechanism behind how the bubble sort algorithm works revolves around comparing each element against its neighboring element in the array. In this implementation, we compare to check if each element is smaller than the left neighbor. At the end of each iteration, the largest element \"bubbles\" up to the end of the unsorted portion of the array (hence, why it's called bubble sort). const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); And voila, we basically created a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. We can make a few changes to make this algorithm perform more efficiently though (in data structures and algorithms courses, the idea is to produce efficient algorithms or structures that utilize as little computer resources and/or time as possible).","title":"Activity: Bubble Sort"},{"location":"lab05/#modifications-for-efficiency","text":"Here the do-while loop makes it such that the whole algorithm keeps iterating over the whole array to see if it is sorted. However, we have established that after each iteration, every last element in the unsorted portion of the array is considered as sorted. Therefore, we do not need each iteration to loop through to check against the sorted portion of the array. We can do this by replacing the do-while loop with another for loop with another iterator variable. After that, we can deduct the value of that iterator variable from array.length in the inner for loop (i.e., array_length - i ). In this implementation, the first iteration checks the whole array since array_length - 0 .

Should you require more guidance, there are plenty of online tutorials detailing multiple solutions - it's best if you can explore and test them out to the best of your ability. Getting Started Functions can be tricky to understand in JavaScript, as unlike some languages like Java or C++, the urgency as to when a function needs to return a value or not is never explicitly stated. Function declarations in JavaScript follow the given syntax: function functionNameHere ( param_1 , param_2 , ..., param_n ) { } The items you include in the round parentheses are referred to as parameters. Sometimes, parameters are required to carry out a function's intended purpose(s). For example, the following function makes use of two number values with intentions to produce the sum after totalling them up. function addition ( number1 , number2 ) { // number addition logic here } The following function, however, does not require any parameter values to display a greeting message, and thus has no parameters associated with it. function greeting () { console . log ( \"Hello World!\" ); } It is imperative to know that there is no such rule that states how many parameters EVERY function needs to have. The number of parameters any function should contain solely lies on any need to depend on any external value(s) to properly carry out its.. well, function. Sometimes, functions can also be used to return values as the last step in completing their purpose(s). In such cases, a return statement is invoked from the function (not necesarily at the end all the time, but merely a traditional thing). For instance, let's refer to the addition function from earlier again. Upon calculating the sum of the two numbers, depending on how you are to present your output, you can choose to have the function just print the sum out or return it out of the function as a form of output at the line that spawned its use. Here's how it will look like if the main idea is to solely print out the sum of the two numbers from within the function: function addition ( number1 , number2 ) { let sum = number1 + number2 ; console . log ( `The sum of the two numbers is ${ sum } .` ); } Here's another variation of the same function, with the main difference being that it returns the sum at the end. function addition ( number1 , number2 ) { let sum = number1 + number2 ; return sum ; // return statement } Admittedly, this may seem relatively confusing as compared to implementing functions in other programming languages like C or Java where one can tell if a function is to return a value or not. For instance, in these two languages the data type of the intended return value is to be explicitly stated in the function declaration itself, or void if it's supposed to not return anything at all. However, just by knowing how you want to craft your function based on the set requirements should be able to provide enough information to keep you going here. Warm-up For each of the following purposes, determine if the function to be created to simulate such should make use of any parameters or not. If so, name them and describe how they will be used in your supposed function. As practice, you may also consider developing these functions with these plans in mind to be used with a HTML page. You may name your parameter(s) and/or function(s) as you please, but preferably with respect to their meaningfulness. This function delivers a greeting based on a selected language from a list of available languages. This function prints out the first 20 numbers in a sequence dictated by an already preset Maclaurin series expression. For testing purposes, you can use the common Maclaurin function: \\[ \\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + ... \\] Use x = 1 to x = 20 in this function. This function gathers two strings to check if the first letter in each one match regardless of case. This function retrieves the user input from a HTML <input> field to prepare an array of distinct characters used in said input. This function calculates the age of a person, place, or object by using its year of origin/date of birth/etc. and the current year during use. Tasks Task 1 Drivers who are 16 years of age and older can apply for driving a license online. The government webpage code requires applicants to enter their age and then checks if they are old enough to apply. The following code captures the applicant\u2019s age. When the applicant clicks the 'Check now' button the age is first checked to ensure that it is numeric. The age is then checked to see if the applicant is old enough. Suitable messages are displayed as a result of the checks. Part 1: Create an empty webpage with the following HTML scripts inside the <body> section. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 < p > You can apply for a license to drive when you are 16 years old. </ p > < p > To check if you are old enough to drive, input your age and click the button: </ p > < input type = \"text\" id = \"ageNow\" /> < button onclick = \"checkAgeFunction()\" > Check now </ button > < p id = \"ageCheck\" ></ p > < script type = \"text/javascript\" > function checkAgeFunction () { /* ---- INSERT CODE HERE ---- */ /* ---- END INSERT CODE ---- */ document . getElementById ( \"ageCheck\" ). innerHTML = CanApply ; } </ script > Part 2: Complete the code for checkAgeFunction() that checks the age entered by the applicant and displays an appropriate response. Task 2 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. Create a function called arrayFromRange() which creates an array of integers between and including the two numbers that are passed into the function. Example: arrayFromRange ( 5 , 10 ); // this should return [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] arrayFromRange ( - 10 , - 4 ); // this should return [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4]; After creating the function, add another line of JavaScript code at the very end of the <script> element to invoke the created function. Task 3 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. You are required to only use the browser's inspector console to generate outputs. Part 1: Create a function that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two. ( NOTE: If the two numbers are the same, the function should return the same number.) Part 2: Create a function that takes in a circle's radius value and returns the area of the circle with that radius. Task 4 Create a HTML file that uses external JavaScript to carry out the following. Part 1: In the <body> section, create a single paragraph <p> element with an id value \"result\" containing the text: \"The FizzBuzz Test\". Part 2: Add a <script> tag referencing a JavaScript file called fizzbuzz.js . Part 3: Create the fizzbuzz.js JavaScript file. It should contain the following code snippet: function fizzBuzz ( input ) { /* ---- CONTINUE CODE FROM HERE ---- */ } const number = 15 ; // edit this constant value to test fizzBuzz() document . getElementById ( \"result\" ). innerHTML = fizzBuzz ( number ); The last line makes it such that the value obtained from the fizzBuzz() function is appended into the <p> element with id \"result\" . Part 4: Complete the fizzBuzz() function such that it return \"Fizz\" if the number is divisible by 3, and \"Buzz\" if it is divisible by 5. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, fizzBuzz() should return \"FizzBuzz\". If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, fizzBuzz() should return the value stored in the used input parameter. // Examples fizzBuzz ( 3 ); // it should return \"Fizz\" fizzBuzz ( 10 ); // it should return \"Buzz\" fizzBuzz ( 30 ); // it should return \"FizzBuzz\" fizzBuzz ( 31 ); // it should return 31 Note Do NOT use document.write() or console.log() in the function. You are required to use the return statement instead. Part 5: Implement a check to see if input is a number or not. If the input is not a number (e.g. string, Boolean), it should print \"Not a number\". This needs to be checked first before determining its divisibility. // these should return \"Not a number\" fizzBuzz ( \"3\" ); fizzBuzz ( false ); Hint Use the typeof operator to check the variable's type. Task 5 Create a HTML file that uses external JavaScript to carry out the following. You are required to only use the browser's inspector console to generate outputs. Part 1: Create an object named movie which contains the following attributes: title: \"Big Hero 6\" releaseYear: 2014 rating: 7.8 director_1: \"Don Hall\" director_2: \"Chris Williams\" Part 2: Use the for-in loop to iterate through the movie object's attributes, printing them each time. Part 3: In the same for/in loop, implement a check such that only the attributes containing string values are printed in the console. Challenge Tasks Challenge Task 1 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following.

Function declarations in JavaScript follow the given syntax: function functionNameHere ( param_1 , param_2 , ..., param_n ) { } The items you include in the round parentheses are referred to as parameters. Sometimes, parameters are required to carry out a function's intended purpose(s). For example, the following function makes use of two number values with intentions to produce the sum after totalling them up. function addition ( number1 , number2 ) { // number addition logic here } The following function, however, does not require any parameter values to display a greeting message, and thus has no parameters associated with it. function greeting () { console . log ( \"Hello World!\" ); } It is imperative to know that there is no such rule that states how many parameters EVERY function needs to have. The number of parameters any function should contain solely lies on any need to depend on any external value(s) to properly carry out its.. well, function. Sometimes, functions can also be used to return values as the last step in completing their purpose(s). In such cases, a return statement is invoked from the function (not necesarily at the end all the time, but merely a traditional thing). For instance, let's refer to the addition function from earlier again. Upon calculating the sum of the two numbers, depending on how you are to present your output, you can choose to have the function just print the sum out or return it out of the function as a form of output at the line that spawned its use. Here's how it will look like if the main idea is to solely print out the sum of the two numbers from within the function: function addition ( number1 , number2 ) { let sum = number1 + number2 ; console . log ( `The sum of the two numbers is ${ sum } .` ); } Here's another variation of the same function, with the main difference being that it returns the sum at the end. function addition ( number1 , number2 ) { let sum = number1 + number2 ; return sum ; // return statement } Admittedly, this may seem relatively confusing as compared to implementing functions in other programming languages like C or Java where one can tell if a function is to return a value or not. For instance, in these two languages the data type of the intended return value is to be explicitly stated in the function declaration itself, or void if it's supposed to not return anything at all. However, just by knowing how you want to craft your function based on the set requirements should be able to provide enough information to keep you going here.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"lab06/#warm-up","text":"For each of the following purposes, determine if the function to be created to simulate such should make use of any parameters or not.

The multiplication box is one of many creative methods concocted by elementary school math teachers to help students understand multiplication between two-digit numbers (i.e., integer values). This method involves separating both numbers into tens and units, and then multiplying them separately before adding their horizontal and vertical totals up. The cell at the bottom right denotes the eventual product between the two numbers. For instance, with \\(49 \\times 16\\) , both numbers are separated as the pairs (40, 9) and (10, 6) respectively. The following multiplication operations are then carried out first: \\(40 \\times 10 = 400\\) \\(40 \\times 6 = 240\\) \\(9 \\times 10 = 90\\) \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\) The numbers are populated as shown in the figure below, where their horizontal totals and vertical totals are calculated and displayed. Between both sets of totals, they produce the same correct product after being added together (i.e., \\(490 + 294 = 640 + 144 = 784\\) ). Multiplication Box Page Take note that the only input fields of concern are the three which make up the equation on top of the multiply button, which is associated with the JavaScript multiply() function we will be completing in this activity. Only the first two are allowed to be populated manually by the user. The third representing the calculated product is set to be read-only . Step 1: Obtaining Values from Input Fields Let's work on obtaining the values entered into the first two input fields. times-box.js 1 2 3 4 function multiply () { let num1 = parseInt ( document . querySelector ( \"#num1\" ). value ); let num2 = parseInt ( document . querySelector ( \"#num2\" ). value ); } (mention about value property to be used when getting text out of input fields) times-box.js 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 function multiply () { let num1 = parseInt ( document . querySelector ( \"#num1\" ). value ); let num2 = parseInt ( document . querySelector ( \"#num2\" ). value ); // replace num1 and num2 with parsed integer (if not integers) // alert user when number is replaced if ( parseFloat ( document . querySelector ( \"#num1\" ). value ) !== parseInt ( document . querySelector ( \"#num1\" ). value )) { if ( document . querySelector ( \"#num1\" ). value == \"\" ) { alert ( \"First number input is empty.\" ); } else { alert ( \"First number isn't an integer.

When the button at the bottom of the page (i.e., Calculate Total and Average) is selected, each student's Assignment 1 and 2's respective point weightage is calculated based on the input marks.

The multiplication box is one of many creative methods concocted by elementary school math teachers to help students understand multiplication between two-digit numbers (i.e., integer values). This method involves separating both numbers into tens and units, and then multiplying them separately before adding their horizontal and vertical totals up. The cell at the bottom right denotes the eventual product between the two numbers. For instance, with \\(49 \\times 16\\) , both numbers are separated as the pairs (40, 9) and (10, 6) respectively. The following multiplication operations are then carried out first: \\(40 \\times 10 = 400\\) \\(40 \\times 6 = 240\\) \\(9 \\times 10 = 90\\) \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\) The numbers are populated as shown in the figure below, where their horizontal totals and vertical totals are calculated and displayed. Between both sets of totals, they produce the same correct product after being added together (i.e., \\(490 + 294 = 640 + 144 = 784\\) ).

Right now, Wendy's HTML programmer has gotten as far as setting up an order for for the cakes Wendy sells. The order form is shown as in the figure below. This is a relatively simple order form, similar to many which you hve probably seen while surfing. The first thing Wendy would like to be able to do is to know what her customer ordered, work out the total of the customer's order, and how much sales tax is payable on the order. Part of the HTML for this is shown in Listing 1. In the form, we have set the form's action to be the name of the PHP script that will process the customer's order and also the name of the form fields.

Task 1: Embedding PHP in HTML To process the form, we'll need to create the script mentioned in the action attribute of the <form> tag called process-order.php . Prepare process-order.php starting off with the following HTML code: process-order.php 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" /> < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > Wendy's Bakery - Order Form </ title > < style > . font-bold { font-weight : bold ; } thead tr { /* table tr:first-of-type { */ background-color : #cccccc ; } th , td { padding : 0.5 rem 1.5 rem ; } form td { text-align : center ; } # freight-table tbody td { text-align : right ; } # order-details { margin-bottom : 1 rem ; } </ style > </ head > < body > < h1 > Wendy's Bakery </ h1 > < h2 > Order Results </ h2 > <!-- Listing 1 goes here --> </ body > </ html > Task 2: Conditional Display of Information Modify process-order.php such that it displays the following when the order form is filled and the Submit button is clicked on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <?php if ( $_SERVER [ 'REQUEST_METHOD' ] == 'POST' ) { // If a form with POST superglobal variable is sent, display this message echo \"<p>Order processed</p>\" ; } else { /** * NOTE: * You can break through to HTML in the middle of a PHP block, * especially if you have a lot of HTML elements to display under * set conditions. */ ?> <!-- Listing 1 goes here --> <?php } ?> Task 3: Adding Dynamic Content Modify process-order.php to display the date and time when the form was submitted. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <?php if ( $_SERVER [ 'REQUEST_METHOD' ] == 'POST' ) { // If a form with POST superglobal variable is sent, display this message echo \"<p>Order processed on \" . <?= date ( \"F jS Y, l, H:i:s\" ); ?> . \"</p>\"; } else { ?> <!-- Listing 1 goes here --> <?php } ?> DateTime in PHP Read more here: PHP DateTime Task 4: Accessing Variables Within the same PHP script, add some lines to display the customer's order list. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 <?php if ( $_SERVER [ 'REQUEST_METHOD' ] == 'POST' ) { // If a form with POST superglobal variable is sent, display this message echo \"<p>Order processed on \" . date ( \"F jS Y, l, H:i:s\" ); . \"</p>\" ; ?> <p class=\"font-bold\">Your order is as follows:</p> <p> 20 cupcakes<br> 10 puffs<br> 15 muffins </p> <?php } else { ?> <!-- Listing 1 goes here --> <?php } ?> Task 5: Assigning Values to Variables On Wendy's site, we want to work out the total number of items ordered and the total amount payable.

Try to find a way to circumvent this issue (i.e., by placing an if statement, modifying the form input element, etc.). See if you can find any loopholes in the web application at this point and look to see if you can fix them as much as possible. Task 7: elseif Statements Wendy provides discounts for large orders of cupcakes. Less than 10 cupcakes: no discount 10-49 cupcakes: 5% discount 50-99 cupcakes: 10% discount \u2265100 cupcakes: 20% discount Modify process-order.php such that it calculates the discount using conditions and if-else and elseif statements. Task 8: switch Statements Wendy wants to know what forms of advertising are working for her. Insert a <select> element to the form to retrieve that information. < tr > < td colspan = \"2\" > < p >< label for = \"find\" > How did you find Wendy's? </ label ></ p > < select name = \"find\" id = \"find\" > < option disabled selected > Select option </ option > < option value = \"a\" > I am a regular customer. </ option > < option value = \"b\" > TV Advertising </ option > < option value = \"c\" > Phone Directory </ option > < option value = \"d\" > Word of Mouth </ option > </ select > </ td > </ tr > Use the appropriate selection statements to handle the variables and display the information in process-order.php . Task 9: Iteration and Repeating Actions Wendy wants a table displaying the freight cost that is to be added to the customer's order. With the courier Wendy's uses, the cost of freight depends on the distance the parcel is being shipped. We want our freight table to resemble the following: Generate the same freight table using loop structures. <table id=\"freight-table\"> <thead> <tr> <th>Distance</th> <th>Cost</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <?php $freight = [ [ \"distance\" => 50 , \"cost\" => 5 ], [ \"distance\" => 100 , \"cost\" => 10 ], [ \"distance\" => 150 , \"cost\" => 15 ], [ \"distance\" => 200 , \"cost\" => 20 ], [ \"distance\" => 250 , \"cost\" => 25 ], ]; // var_dump($freight); foreach ( $freight as $f ) { ?> <tr> <td> <? = $f [ \"distance\" ]; ?> </td> <td> <? = $f [ \"cost\" ]; ?> </td> </tr> <?php } ?> </tbody> </table>","title":"Practical 08: Introducing PHP into Forms"},{"location":"lab08/#practical-08-introducing-php-into-forms","text":"In this practical activity, we will be implementing an order form for Wendy's Bakery, a fictional bakery company.

In this case, credentials.php is appended at the beginning of the webpage. There are other variants of this command: include_once is the same as require_once , but it does not halt the other webpage items from being loaded if the file doesn't exist. include and require are different from include_once and require_once respectively in the sense of how many times they are allowed to be appended to the page.

Uncomment the var_dump line if you would like to carry out this checking, but its output should not be visible in the end result. We are adding the sessions_start() line on top to introduce session variables if the credentials match. This will be worked on more in the next task, but what's important now is that we create a new session variable called $_SESSION[\"username\"] which will contain the username value entered into the form. As for when the credentials do not match, we have a flag variable named $invalid_login which indicates if the credentials match or not. We will utilize this to display a message in our p#error element in the form to alert users if the credentials do not match. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <form action=\".\" method=\"post\"> <p id=\"error\"> <?php if ( $invalid_login ) : ?> Invalid credentials! <?php endif ; ?> </p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" id=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\" /><br /> <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" /><br /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\" /> <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\" /> </form> The if statement syntax used here is different from that of most languages, but it works especially if you plan on printing large and/or complex lines of HTML.

Task 2: Implementing Logout Feature Session variables get carried across multiple webpages, so long as they have the line session_start() on top of the page - this is compulsory. In the end, however, all good things have to come to an end - this also includes logged-in sessions. The logout button included has an onclick attribute which redirects the browser to another page called logout.php . logout.php will contain a simple script to log a user out. The contents of this script are as follows: <?php session_start (); session_unset (); session_destroy (); header ( \"Location: .\" ); ?> The simple logout process works in 3 steps: Start the session with session_start() . Unset all session variables with session_unset() . Destroy the session using session_destroy() . One main reason why session_destroy() does not settle everything without session_unset() is that it only destroys the session, but any session data is still kept around. Think of it as a job not completely done properly in such case. The fourth line (i.e., header(\"Location: .\"); ) redirects the user immediately back to index.php . This can also be achieved if you were to type in header(\"Location: index.php\"); . Using a period punctuation here points to the current directory, and browsers will automatically search for any file named index.php or index.html by default. With this, you will find that you will immediately be sent back to index.php without viewing anything in logout.php .. not that it contains any visual content to be displayed in the browser to begin with.

For the purpose of this exercise, we will carry out everything in phpMyAdmin, but the SQL scripts can be run on a typical MySQL console. To access phpMyAdmin, type in localhost/phpmyadmin in your web browser's address bar. NOTE For those who installed each component of the LAMP stack individually including the MySQL database, ensure you remember your root user password. Starting Out in phpMyAdmin On the top menu bar, select \"SQL\". You should see an interface like as follows: This will be where we will be typing in our SQL scripts for today's practical exercise. Creating a New Database The basic syntax to create a new database is as follows: CREATE DATABASE < database_name > ; Let's create a database named exercise_db . We will create the database by entering the following script: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ` exercise_db ` ; Note that throughout my demo, I will be using backticks (`) to surround any names given to the database, tables and columns. This is completely optional. Upon running this command, you can only run it once as you can only create a database with a stated name if it already does not exist. The IF NOT EXISTS clause will make it such that the statement can be run multiple times instead of spititng out an error each time, but it also does nothing as a result. Select the \"Go\" button to execute the SQL statement, and a message from the database server should be displayed like as shown below: By now, the database should now be available to use - the database name should appear on the left hand side of the window. DROP DATABASES The opposite act of creating a database is referred as dropping a database. If you wish to drop the database, you have to use the following command script: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ` exercise_db ` ; The IF EXISTS clause works the same way as how the IF NOT EXISTS clause works for the CREATE TABLE statement - you can only drop a database if it actually exists in the database server. The general syntax for dropping a database is as follows: DROP DATABASE < database_name > ; Create a Table Right now, the database does not have any tables inside of it. Let's create a new table called Student that has the following columns: id: INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, NOT NULL, Primary Key first_name: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL last_name: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL age: INT(3), NOT NULL email: VARCHAR(255) active: BOOL, NOT NULL, DEFAULT is TRUE(1) Note: INT : integer value (default size 7); VARCHAR(50) : max 50 alphanumeric characters, BOOLEAN : boolean value We set id as our PRIMARY KEY of the table - this is a unique column which distinguishes each record/row from each other. AUTO_INCREMENT is often used with primary key columns so that they need not be defined when entering records. NOT NULL constraint makes a column unable to be empty in any record. The script to create this table is as follows. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ` Student ` ( ` id ` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ` first_name ` VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL , ` last_name ` VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL , ` age ` INT ( 3 ) NOT NULL , ` email ` VARCHAR ( 255 ), ` active ` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE , PRIMARY KEY ( ` id ` ) ); You can view the database table contents by selecting the table name from the left-hand side menu in the browser window. Multiple Tables in Databases Yes, you are allowed to have multiple tables in your database (unless it's a SQLite database). In fact, there are mechanisms to simplify tables so that they don't require so many columns (i.e., normalization) and/or so that tables are linked together with foreign keys . We will not cover them in this module, but feel free to look up on how they work if you are curious! Dropping Tables Just like dropping databases, you can also drop a table if you want to recreate the table from scratch. DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ` Student ` ; Populating the Database Table Let's populate the table with some data. The following command script adds in one record of data in the database. INSERT INTO ` Student ` ( ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` , ` age ` , ` email ` , ` active ` ) VALUES ( \"Adam\" , \"Burns\" , 18 , \"adam_burns@gmail.com\" , 1 ); After running the given command, you should see the table being populated like as follows: Take note that with id being set to AUTO_INCREMENT , there's no need to specify the id value when adding new records (it will automatically start from 1 by default). However, you are still allowed to put in a custom id value if you so desire. Also, note that the active value is set to TRUE or 1 by default. In this case, you can shorten your SQL command to be like as follows and it should give the same result: INSERT INTO ` Student ` ( ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` , ` age ` , ` email ` ) VALUES ( \"Adam\" , \"Burns\" , 18 , \"adam_burns@gmail.com\" ); Task Populate the table with more records: id first_name last_name age email active 2 Karen Allen 19 karen_allen@outlook.com 1 3 Mark Weiss 24 hello@mweiss.com 0 4 Tyson Russell 16 ask@tyson.com 1 Updating Records in a Table Let's update Mark's record to say that he is now no longer inactive (i.e., active = 1). UPDATE ` Student ` SET ` active ` = 1 WHERE ` id ` = 3 ; Mark's record is indicated with id 3. As mentioned prior, we can make utilize this column to uniquely identify one record from the others. However, this is not restricted to just primary keys or unique columns like id . When feasible, one may also utilize other columns that are not unique to easily modify multiple records at once. Also, you can also have multiple conditions in your SQL script to further specify those columns to consider as well. The table contents should now look like the following: Task Run SQL commands to make the following changes: Adam has recently changed his e-mail to adam@burnings.com . Tyson is no longer an active student. Karen's age is to be updated to 20 instead of 19. Selecting Records from a Table By now, you should see the given SQL command script appear upon selecting the table in phpMyAdmin: SELECT * FROM ` Student ` ; * is representative of \"ALL\". The above syntax simply means to select all available records in Student . You can specify which records/rows to select by adding conditions. The following example will select the row(s) where the id value is equal to 2: SELECT * FROM ` Student ` WHERE ` id ` = 2 ; You can also make comparison conditions too when selecting columns. The following example will select only the first and last names of the row(s) where the age is greater than 21: SELECT ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` FROM ` Student ` WHERE ` age ` > 21 ; Task Populate the Student table with 4 more records. Select all students whose age is not greater than 20. Select all active students, displaying only the first_name , last_name , and email . Deleting Records from a Table Deleting records works the same as updating and selecting records - you can utilize IDs as indicators of which record(s) to delete. For example, if we want to delete Tyson's record, we can use the following command script: DELETE FROM ` Student ` WHERE ` id ` = 4 ; # Tyson ' s record id value is 4 The same rules for selecting which type of records based on what column(s) to update also apply to what column(s) to delete. Note about id Progression Now that we've deleted Tyson's record, if you are to add another record after, the id will not reassume as 4, but will continue after the number of the last record instead.

We will create the database by entering the following script: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ` exercise_db ` ; Note that throughout my demo, I will be using backticks (`) to surround any names given to the database, tables and columns. This is completely optional. Upon running this command, you can only run it once as you can only create a database with a stated name if it already does not exist. The IF NOT EXISTS clause will make it such that the statement can be run multiple times instead of spititng out an error each time, but it also does nothing as a result. Select the \"Go\" button to execute the SQL statement, and a message from the database server should be displayed like as shown below: By now, the database should now be available to use - the database name should appear on the left hand side of the window. DROP DATABASES The opposite act of creating a database is referred as dropping a database. If you wish to drop the database, you have to use the following command script: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ` exercise_db ` ; The IF EXISTS clause works the same way as how the IF NOT EXISTS clause works for the CREATE TABLE statement - you can only drop a database if it actually exists in the database server. The general syntax for dropping a database is as follows: DROP DATABASE < database_name > ;","title":"Creating a New Database"},{"location":"lab10/#create-a-table","text":"Right now, the database does not have any tables inside of it. Let's create a new table called Student that has the following columns: id: INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, NOT NULL, Primary Key first_name: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL last_name: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL age: INT(3), NOT NULL email: VARCHAR(255) active: BOOL, NOT NULL, DEFAULT is TRUE(1) Note: INT : integer value (default size 7); VARCHAR(50) : max 50 alphanumeric characters, BOOLEAN : boolean value We set id as our PRIMARY KEY of the table - this is a unique column which distinguishes each record/row from each other. AUTO_INCREMENT is often used with primary key columns so that they need not be defined when entering records. NOT NULL constraint makes a column unable to be empty in any record. The script to create this table is as follows. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ` Student ` ( ` id ` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ` first_name ` VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL , ` last_name ` VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL , ` age ` INT ( 3 ) NOT NULL , ` email ` VARCHAR ( 255 ), ` active ` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE , PRIMARY KEY ( ` id ` ) ); You can view the database table contents by selecting the table name from the left-hand side menu in the browser window. Multiple Tables in Databases Yes, you are allowed to have multiple tables in your database (unless it's a SQLite database). In fact, there are mechanisms to simplify tables so that they don't require so many columns (i.e., normalization) and/or so that tables are linked together with foreign keys . We will not cover them in this module, but feel free to look up on how they work if you are curious!

However, you are still allowed to put in a custom id value if you so desire. Also, note that the active value is set to TRUE or 1 by default. In this case, you can shorten your SQL command to be like as follows and it should give the same result: INSERT INTO ` Student ` ( ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` , ` age ` , ` email ` ) VALUES ( \"Adam\" , \"Burns\" , 18 , \"adam_burns@gmail.com\" );","title":"Populating the Database Table"},{"location":"lab10/#task","text":"Populate the table with more records: id first_name last_name age email active 2 Karen Allen 19 karen_allen@outlook.com 1 3 Mark Weiss 24 hello@mweiss.com 0 4 Tyson Russell 16 ask@tyson.com 1","title":"Task"},{"location":"lab10/#updating-records-in-a-table","text":"Let's update Mark's record to say that he is now no longer inactive (i.e., active = 1).

Well, if you decided to open and follow this guide for whatever your reason may be, here's a rundown of what you'll need to do to set up the LAMP stack inside your macOS machine. Let's get started! Take Note As of writing this guide, we are using macOS Big Sur (macOS 11.0+), PHP 8.0.9, MySQL Community Server 8.0.25, and phpMyAdmin 5.1.1. This guide may get outdated rather quickly, so if you're reading this after at least a year from the publication of this guide, do due diligence and find out if any of the steps no longer apply to you. Step 1: Start the Apache Server macOS comes with the Apache Server by default. To start the built-in Apache server, open the Terminal app from your Application folder or type Terminal in the Spotlight Search (shortcut: Cmd + Space ). Type sudo apachectl start and press Enter. Open your web browser and type localhost or 127.0.0.1 in the address bar. If the Apache Server has successfully started, you should see this appear in your web browser: Step 2: Create Sites Directory Fancy, yes? The page you're looking at now is a result of a default web page file that is in the following location: /Library/WebServer/Documents To be precise, this file you're looking at is named index.html.en . However, that's quite a hard-to-remember location if you're not well-versed with the ins and outs of your system. In addition, this folder's contents cannot be edited without changing a few permissions by default. As a workaround, we will create a Sites directory under your home folder and use that folder to contain all our PHP web files. At the end of this guide, typing in localhost or 127.0.0.1 in your web browser's address bar will source the web files from this folder for view. Heawd over to your account folder. This one should be the folder with your computer's name on it. The full location of this folder is: Macintosh HD/Users/<your_account_folder> Create a folder named Sites. Upon creating the folder, the folder icon should now have a compass image appear on top of it like as shown below: For easier access, I have it as a shortcut in the Finder window's left-hand menu (just drag this Sites folder over to the left menu). You can also drag it to the dock if you so desire. Step 3: Create username.conf File To be able to recognize the files stashed inside the Sites directory, you will require setting up a configuration file called <username>.conf (i.e., if the account username I'm using in my machine is henryheng612 , my configuration file should be called henryheng612.conf ). If you're not sure what your account username is, type whoami in the Terminal and hit Enter. This UNIX command will reveal it inside your Terminal window. Remember to note that name down, we will be using it shortly. Right now, the Terminal window is currently inside your account folder. We will need to create this configuration file in a different location. Type the following command line and press Enter. cd /etc/apache2/users Extra Note: cd is the command in UNIX to navigate out of your current directory to a new one. Type ls and press Enter again. This command displays all visible files in the current file directory (to include ones hidden by default, type ls -a instead). Check to see if there is an existing <username>.conf file (it will appear in the Terminal window if it exists). If so, make a backup copy by entering the following command: sudo cp <username>.conf <username>.conf.bak Remember to replace all instances of <username> with your own account username! Extra Note: sudo is used to request administrator access in a UNIX system. Often if you use sudo , you'll be prompted to enter your password. Don't worry, this is normal. We are now ready to create/edit our configuration file. Type sudo nano <username>.conf in the Terminal window and press Enter. If the file does not exist, you should see a blank window space. Extra Note: nano is a text editor used in UNIX command line interface (CLI) systems that functions like any regular text editor you've used before, just without mousr support and some nice-to-have features. Frequent UNIX users will find themselves using it often. Alternatives are vi and vim , and I think there's a debate among some nerds about which is best. Unless this piques your interest, you need not know the details behind it. Copy and paste the following configuration. <Directory \"Users/<username>/Sites/\"> AllowOverride All Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks Require all granted </Directory> A gentle reminder: Remember to replace all instances of <username> with your account username! Press Ctrl + O and press Enter to save the file. Press Ctrl + X and press Enter to exit the nano editor. Step 4: Configure the httpd.conf File Now there's also another configuration file we'll need to modify, namely the httpd.conf file. In your Terminal window, enter in cd /etc/apache2 Type ls and press Enter again. You should see httpd.conf being listed as one of the files inside the current directory. Type sudo cp httpd.conf httpd.conf.bak and press Enter. This will create a backup of this configuration file in case something goes awry. Type sudo nano httpd.conf and press Enter. You should see something like this appear in the nano text editor in your Terminal window. Press Ctrl + W , type in LoadModule authz_core_module and press Enter. We are using a search feature in the nano text editor to look for specific lines inside this file. Uncomment the following modules. The # you see in front of each line means that line is commented out (i.e., that specific line or module will be ignored). What we want to do is to enable these modules in our Apache server. LoadModule authn_core_module libexec/apache2/mod_authn_core.so LoadModule authz_host_module libexec/apache2/mod_authz_host.so LoadModule userdir_module libexec/apache2/mod_userdir.so LoadModule include_module libexec/apache2/mod_include.so LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so Uncomment the following line for the User home directories. Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf Press Ctrl + W , search up DocumentRoot and press Enter. We want to edit the following two lines \u2013 this shows DocumentRoot configuration in httpd.conf which dictates the folder where your machine will source its web files to be used inside localhost. ... DocumentRoot \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\" <Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\"> ... You may choose to replace them completely with these two lines or add them after commenting the latter. ... DocumentRoot \"/Users/<username>/Sites/\" <Directory \"/Users/<username>/Sites/\"> ... A gentle reminder: Remember to replace all instances of <username> with your account username! Press Ctrl + W , search up AllowOverride None and press Enter. Here, replace this line with AllowOVerride All . Your DocumentRoot configuration in httpd.conf should look like as follows: For extra measure, we can set the Apache Server to serve an index.php file instance first before an index.html. Press Ctrl + W , search up DirectoryIndex and press Enter. You should see the following: From the line where it says DirectoryIndex index.html Add index.php so it now says DirectoryIndex index.php index.html Press Ctrl + O and press Enter to save the file. Press Ctrl + X and press Enter to exit the nano editor. Step 5: Configure the httpd-userdir.conf File In yuor Terminal window, enter in cd /etc/apache2/extra . Type ls and press Enter again. You should see httpd-userdir.conf being listed as one of the files inside the current directory. Type sudo cp httpd-userdir.conf httpd-userdir.conf.bak and press Enter. This will create a backup of this configuration file in case something goes awry. Type sudo nano httpd-userdir.conf and press Enter. You should see something like this appear in the nano text editor in your Terminal window: Uncomment the following line. Include /private/etc/apache2/users/*.conf Press Ctrl + O and press Enter to save the file. Press Ctrl + X and press Enter to exit the nano editor. After carrying out the previous 5 steps, type in sudo apachectl restart amd press Enter. If you type in localhost or 127.0.0.1 in your web browser's address bar now, it should show a 403 Forbidden Access error akin to the following: Not to worry! It means everything's been set up properly so far. This error is caused due to the Sites folder we created not having an index.php or index.html file to display. Step 6: Enable PHP 8.0 macOS has PHP built in (at least in macOS Big Sur and earlier). The PHP shipped with Big Sur is PHP version 7.3.22, which Apple hints on removing in one of the upcoming future versions of macOS. Regardless, we will be using a fresh install of PHP 8.0 using an installation package manager called Homebrew. Head over to https://brew.sh . You will be greeted with Homebrew's home page as follows: The first section you should see is \"Install Homebrew\", where there's a Terminal command line following the title. Copy that command line and run it in a Terminal window. This will install Homebrew inside your Mac. Give it time, it will be ready for use shortly. After installing Homebrew, type in brew install php . This will install PHP as well as any other software dependencies required into your Mac (think of software dependencies as pre-requisites). Open a new tab in the Terminal (or reboot the Terminal application). If you enter in php --version , you should view the PHP version being used like as follows: NOTE ABOUT THIS TERMINAL WINDOW INTERFACE I'm currently using Oh My Zsh in my terminal, this is not required for you to follow this whole guide. If you would like to try out my not-so-custom Oh My Zsh Terminal theme, look up how to install Oh My Zsh first, then head over to the following link to download my theme. Have fun either way! My Custom Theme Here Now that PHP's been installed in your Mac, we will need Apache to use this PHP by default. To do this, we will have to return to our httpd.conf file once more to make some further changes. In your Terminal window, enter in sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf . You may have noticed that after successfully installing PHP with Homebrew. If you've missed it, you can type in brew info php and the instructions will reappear again. Refer to the part under Caveats . This part details what is required to add into your httpd.conf file. Depending on your Mac (from what I've known from M1 Mac users, the file locations may vary), you may be asked to insert the following or a variant of it: LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so <FilesMatch \\.php$> SetHandler application/x-httpd-php </FilesMatch> That is all which will be needed Press Ctrl + W , search up LoadModule php and press Enter. After the last LoadModule line, paste the required lines as mentioned in Line 7. Danger Do not uncomment the following line! #LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so Uncommenting this will get Apache to run the outdated PHP that came with your Mac, we don't want this. Press Ctrl + O and press Enter to save the file. Press Ctrl + X and press Enter to exit the nano editor. Type in sudo apachectl restart and press Enter. This should enable the changes we made to have Apache run PHP 8.0 in your Mac. Is PHP working properly now? To check if PHP is working on your local Mac's web server, we will be creating a phpinfo() file to load into your browser. Go to your Sites folder and create a file called phpinfo.php . In phpinfo.php , put in the following code and save the file: phpinfo.php 1 <?php phpinfo (); ?> If you type in localhost/phpinfo.php or 127.0.0.1/phpinfo.php in your web browser's address bar, you should see something like this: Congratulations, you're now running a current version of PHP on your local web server! Step 7: Install MySQL You will also require a MySQL or mariaDB database server. This step will involve installing MySQL's Community Server inside your Mac to use \u2013 if you plan on learning more on MySQL databases, consider this a way to kill two birds with one stone! \ud83d\ude01 Like with PHP, you can install MySQL or mariaDB with Homebrew. However, the following instructions will focus more towards not interacting with the Terminal as much as possible. Head over to the following link and download the DMG Archive installer. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ Proceed with the installation up until you reach Configuration stage (this should be the second last part of the installation process). At the Configuration stage, you will be required to select a Password Encryption type. We will be installing one more piece of software to access our MySQL database later, but it will not work well if we choose the Strong Password Encryption option. In this case, select Use Legacy Password Encryption. Enter in your MySQL database password. OOPS! If you proceeded with the Strong Password Encryption by mistake during installation, don't worry. Head over to System Preferences, and you should see MySQL as one of the last options in the window as follows: Select the MySQL option and you will be greeted with a dashboard like as follows: Select Initialize Database and you'll be greeted with this screen. Select Use Legacy Password Encryption and enter your password again. Crisis averted!! \ud83d\ude0c Open up a NEW Terminal window and type in ls -a . Look and see if either a file called .zshrc or .bashrc exists inside your account folder. In this example, my machine has .zshrc . If you have .zshrc like in my case (this should be true for all those running macOS Cataline or later), type the following command: echo \"export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/\" >> ~/.zshrc If you're using .bashrc instead, type the following command: echo \"export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/\" >> ~/.bashrc Open a new Terminal window and enter in mysql --version . It should print out the version of MySQL installed in your machine. Type in mysql -u root -p . You should be prompted to enter the password you've set for MySQL. Once you've entered the correct password, you should see a CLI nterface to enter MySQL commands. We don't need to do anything here for now, so just type in exit and press Enter to exit this interface. If you like, you can also proceed to install MySQL Workbench. It is an IDE that is primarily used to create and test MySQL scripts. However, we will be using something else instead for this module.. and that is phpMyAdmin. Step 8: Install phpMyAdmin Alright, the last thing you'll need to install and/or configure.. I promise! Also like PHP, you can install phpMyAdmin using Homebrew, but we will again avoid using the Terminal like for MySQL in the following instructions. Head over to the following link to download phpMyAdmin (which is in a zip file): https://phpmyadmin.net Unzip the zip file. Rename the folder to just \"phpmyadmin\" and move it to the Sites folder. If you type in localhost/phpinfo.php or 127.0.0.1/phpinfo.php in your browser's address bar, you should be greeted with a login page like this: Type in root as your username and enter the password you set when installing MySQL earlier. You should now be greeted with a control panel like this: And... you're done! That is all you need to install and configure to prepare a LAMP stack from scratch. I hope you've gained a sense of accomplishment from going through these steps, it's a fruitful one! If you have any more questions, you know where to reach me. \ud83d\ude09 References [Tech CookBook] Setting Up Your Local Web Server on macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (2020) | MAMP | macOS, Apache, MySQL, PHP.

The PHP shipped with Big Sur is PHP version 7.3.22, which Apple hints on removing in one of the upcoming future versions of macOS. Regardless, we will be using a fresh install of PHP 8.0 using an installation package manager called Homebrew. Head over to https://brew.sh . You will be greeted with Homebrew's home page as follows: The first section you should see is \"Install Homebrew\", where there's a Terminal command line following the title. Copy that command line and run it in a Terminal window. This will install Homebrew inside your Mac. Give it time, it will be ready for use shortly. After installing Homebrew, type in brew install php . This will install PHP as well as any other software dependencies required into your Mac (think of software dependencies as pre-requisites). Open a new tab in the Terminal (or reboot the Terminal application). If you enter in php --version , you should view the PHP version being used like as follows: NOTE ABOUT THIS TERMINAL WINDOW INTERFACE I'm currently using Oh My Zsh in my terminal, this is not required for you to follow this whole guide. If you would like to try out my not-so-custom Oh My Zsh Terminal theme, look up how to install Oh My Zsh first, then head over to the following link to download my theme. Have fun either way! My Custom Theme Here Now that PHP's been installed in your Mac, we will need Apache to use this PHP by default. To do this, we will have to return to our httpd.conf file once more to make some further changes. In your Terminal window, enter in sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf . You may have noticed that after successfully installing PHP with Homebrew. If you've missed it, you can type in brew info php and the instructions will reappear again. Refer to the part under Caveats . This part details what is required to add into your httpd.conf file. Depending on your Mac (from what I've known from M1 Mac users, the file locations may vary), you may be asked to insert the following or a variant of it: LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so <FilesMatch \\.php$> SetHandler application/x-httpd-php </FilesMatch> That is all which will be needed Press Ctrl + W , search up LoadModule php and press Enter. After the last LoadModule line, paste the required lines as mentioned in Line 7. Danger Do not uncomment the following line! #LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so Uncommenting this will get Apache to run the outdated PHP that came with your Mac, we don't want this. Press Ctrl + O and press Enter to save the file. Press Ctrl + X and press Enter to exit the nano editor. Type in sudo apachectl restart and press Enter. This should enable the changes we made to have Apache run PHP 8.0 in your Mac.","title":"Step 6: Enable PHP 8.0"},{"location":"lamp_macos/#is-php-working-properly-now","text":"To check if PHP is working on your local Mac's web server, we will be creating a phpinfo() file to load into your browser.

This step will involve installing MySQL's Community Server inside your Mac to use \u2013 if you plan on learning more on MySQL databases, consider this a way to kill two birds with one stone! \ud83d\ude01 Like with PHP, you can install MySQL or mariaDB with Homebrew. However, the following instructions will focus more towards not interacting with the Terminal as much as possible. Head over to the following link and download the DMG Archive installer. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ Proceed with the installation up until you reach Configuration stage (this should be the second last part of the installation process). At the Configuration stage, you will be required to select a Password Encryption type. We will be installing one more piece of software to access our MySQL database later, but it will not work well if we choose the Strong Password Encryption option. In this case, select Use Legacy Password Encryption. Enter in your MySQL database password. OOPS! If you proceeded with the Strong Password Encryption by mistake during installation, don't worry. Head over to System Preferences, and you should see MySQL as one of the last options in the window as follows: Select the MySQL option and you will be greeted with a dashboard like as follows: Select Initialize Database and you'll be greeted with this screen. Select Use Legacy Password Encryption and enter your password again. Crisis averted!! \ud83d\ude0c Open up a NEW Terminal window and type in ls -a . Look and see if either a file called .zshrc or .bashrc exists inside your account folder. In this example, my machine has .zshrc . If you have .zshrc like in my case (this should be true for all those running macOS Cataline or later), type the following command: echo \"export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/\" >> ~/.zshrc If you're using .bashrc instead, type the following command: echo \"export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/\" >> ~/.bashrc Open a new Terminal window and enter in mysql --version . It should print out the version of MySQL installed in your machine. Type in mysql -u root -p . You should be prompted to enter the password you've set for MySQL. Once you've entered the correct password, you should see a CLI nterface to enter MySQL commands. We don't need to do anything here for now, so just type in exit and press Enter to exit this interface. If you like, you can also proceed to install MySQL Workbench. It is an IDE that is primarily used to create and test MySQL scripts. However, we will be using something else instead for this module.. and that is phpMyAdmin.","title":"Step 7: Install MySQL"},{"location":"lamp_macos/#step-8-install-phpmyadmin","text":"Alright, the last thing you'll need to install and/or configure.. I promise! Also like PHP, you can install phpMyAdmin using Homebrew, but we will again avoid using the Terminal like for MySQL in the following instructions. Head over to the following link to download phpMyAdmin (which is in a zip file): https://phpmyadmin.net Unzip the zip file. Rename the folder to just \"phpmyadmin\" and move it to the Sites folder. If you type in localhost/phpinfo.php or 127.0.0.1/phpinfo.php in your browser's address bar, you should be greeted with a login page like this: Type in root as your username and enter the password you set when installing MySQL earlier. You should now be greeted with a control panel like this: And... you're done! That is all you need to install and configure to prepare a LAMP stack from scratch.

However, this is not the only choice available - some good alternatives include Atom, Sublime Text, and Notepad++ (for Windows users only). Of course, you are not forbidden to use a different code editor you're already familiar with, as long as you are able to make web scripts with it. Visual Studio Code Extensions Visual Studio Code has plenty of extensions which can either make your code editor appear more visually appealing, or help ease your workflow with some useful fixes. The ones I will be using prevalently are as follows: Highlight Matching Tag by vincaslt ( vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag ) - This is helpful especially for checking if your tag pairs are correctly placed or omitted by mistake. Live Server by Ritwich Dey ( ritwickdey.liveserver ) - Up until we learn PHP, this will be the quick way to view our web pages without digging into our file directory to display our web pages in our web browser. Prettier - Code formatter by Prettier ( esbenp.prettier-vscode ) - This will be our code formatter in order to have our web files properly indented and formatted (hence the name). Also, do take note that I also have this extension installed in my instance of Visual Studio Code: IntelliJ IDEA Keybindings by Keisuke Kato ( k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings ) This extension makes it such that some of my shortcut keys are different from what is initially set by Microsoft themselves. You may choose not to install this extension, this one should do absolutely nothing to your workflow especially if you're not the type to use complex shortcut keys aside from your Ctrl + X / Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V combo ( Cmd + X / Cmd + C and Cmd + V for macOS ). However, if I mention any keyboard shortcut that does not translate on your end, you may want to do due diligence and find out what the original keybindings are. You will be able to install your extensions by clicking on the Extensions tab on the left hand side (the shortcut is Shift + Cmd + X on macOS or Ctrl + Shift + X on Windows). You can find out more about what these extensions do when you select and find them from there. Note Do note that you are not required to download these extensions in order for you to carry on with the class. These extensions are only meant to help with easing your web scripting/programming experiences with Visual Studio Code. Testing Visual Studio Code Out To open a project directory, you can click on \"Open...\" from the Getting Started page or from the top menu bar and locate it that way. Alternatively, you can click and drag your project folder from your File Explorer/Finder window and into the Visual Studio Code interface - this is a pretty quick way to get started and should be applicable in most code editors. Create a web page file named index.html your project directory. After that, copy and paste the following into your web page: index.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > < title > Testing HTML </ title > </ head > < body > < h1 > It works! </ h1 > </ body > </ html > If you downloaded the Live Server extension, you should be able to view a link that says \"Go Live\". Click that link and it will open up your web page in a small web server with the IP address 127:.0.0.1:5500 . The port 5500 may not apply depending on what is currently running inside your machine. The output should be as follows: Any change you make to your web page right after upon saving will immediately refresh what is shown on the web browser automatically - this means you won't need to instinctively refresh your browser each time you make a change. Click the link again to stop the Live Server from refreshing. Alternatively, in the Explorer side bar, you can right click on the HTML file you're working on and select \"Open with Live Server\".","title":"Practical Preparation"},{"location":"practical-preparation/#practical-preparation","text":"","title":"Practical Preparation"},{"location":"practical-preparation/#code-editor","text":"Going forward, I will be using Visual Studio Code as my code editor of choice during demos.

One of the useful applications of using PHP in web development includes form data collection and processing. Getting Started To carry on with programming in PHP, you will require an Apache server installed in your local machine. Not only that, this server will also need to contain PHP and a few database software. In short, you will need what is often referred as a LAMP stack. Fortunately, one may find the LAMP stack already bundled in various packages like XAMPP. XAMPP is available across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS and Linux. Head here to obtain the XAMPP installer: XAMPP Installer Head here to obtain the MAMP installer: MAMP Installer M1 Macs Incompatibility As of now, I think that M1 Macs are incompatible with XAMPP. If you're part of the demographic that uses an M1 Mac, you may want to look for alternatives like MAMP.

IMPORTANT: Location of Project Files for PHP Development Upon installation, the location of the XAMPP web server files in Windows is in C:\\xampp by default. On macOS, XAMPP acts like an external volume that has to be mounted each time you need to use it. Pay close attention to where a folder called htdocs is. Unlike previously when you can basically open your HTML files from just about anywhere in your local machine, PHP files will only work within the server file directory. In particular, you will need to stash your project files inside a folder named htdocs from now on. First PHP Script Ensure that both the Apache server and the MySQL are running as according to the contol panel. Inside the htdocs folder, create a PHP file named test.php .

However, this is not the only choice available - some good alternatives include Atom, Sublime Text, and Notepad++ (for Windows users only). Of course, you are not forbidden to use a different code editor you're already familiar with, as long as you are able to make web scripts with it. Visual Studio Code Extensions Visual Studio Code has plenty of extensions which can either make your code editor appear more visually appealing, or help ease your workflow with some useful fixes. The ones I will be using prevalently are as follows: Highlight Matching Tag by vincaslt ( vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag ) - This is helpful especially for checking if your tag pairs are correctly placed or omitted by mistake. Live Server by Ritwich Dey ( ritwickdey.liveserver ) - Up until we learn PHP, this will be the quick way to view our web pages without digging into our file directory to display our web pages in our web browser.

Files with the name index are often treated as home pages in web sites. For example, when one visits TIMeS , the browser would immediately look for a file whose name is index if the name of the file is not specified. Let's just say TIMeS has a page called login.html .

For example, if a web site with domain www.example.com has a file named page 1.html , the address bar in a web browser will have to interpret the link to that page as: www.example.com/page%201.html The best practice is to clump the words making up the file name together without spaces (i.e., page1.html ), or to add a hyphen - or underscore ( _ ) to separate each word (i.e., page-1.html , page_1.html ).

Task In both web pages you created, apply the various CSS styles you've learnt in lecture (e.g., background color, fonts, image positioning, etc.). When applying CSS to your web pages, look up some good aesthetic principles web designers or developers take when designing their web sites. Try to apply those principles in your web pages wherever possible. Optional Task: CSS Responsiveness Try and implement a styling that only applies itself in mobile screens. You may look up a screen resolution for a mobile device of your choice (e.g., iPhones, tablet screens). Getting Started CSS can be applied in three different methods. The encouraged method is having your CSS in an external CSS file (i.e., external style). When referencing a CSS file, one ought to use the <link> tag within the head section of the HTML document. For example, to reference styles.css in your HTML document, the placement of your CSS <link> reference should be like as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <!DOCTYPE html> < html > < head > <!-- some head content --> < link rel = \"stylesheet\" type = \"text/css\" href = \"styles.css\" /> </ head > < body > <!-- body content here --> </ body > </ html > CSS Responsiveness CSS responsiveness typically has to do with making sure that web sites can adapt to different screen resolutions from different devices.

Part 1: Display the numbers between 5 to 22 (inclusive of both) in ascending order using a for loop in the browser's console. Part 2: In the same HTML file, display the numbers between -14 and 7 (exclusive of both) in descending order using a for loop in the browser's console.

What is the difference between these two loops in terms of their functions? Task 4 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. Prompt users to enter a year using a prompt box. Set the default value to the current year. After entering the year, the browser window should display the Chinese zodiac animal that corresponds with the given remainder after dividing by 12: Remainder Chinese Zodiac Animal Remainder Chinese Zodiac Animal 0 Monkey 6 Tiger 1 Rooster 7 Rabbit 2 Dog 8 Dragon 3 Pig 9 Snake 4 Rat 10 Horse 5 Ox 11 Sheep Task 5 The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health on weight. A person's BMI is calculated by taking the person's weight (in kilograms) divided by the person's height squared (height in meters).

Task 6 Create a HTML file that uses external JavaScript to carry out the following. Create an external JavaScript file that contains an array named students which contains the following values: 'Anthony', 'Barry', 'Desmond', 'Grenda'. Print the students array in the console. Utilize a for-of loop to display the array elements in the console. Pop the last element in the students array (i.e., Grenda). Hint Use the pop() function. Append the values 'Marie' and 'Zacchaeus' to the end of the students array. Print the array again; you do not need any loop structure this time. Hint Use the push() function. Remove the first value from the students array (i.e., Anthony), and replace it with a new element 'Charlie'. Print the array again; just like last time, you do not need any loop structure here. Hint There exists a shift() function that can do one of the given requirements here. Perhaps there's also an unshift function which does the opposite as well? Activity: Bubble Sort Bubble sort is one of many types of sorting algorithms taught in data structures and algorithms courses. Watch the following video to understand the concept behind bubble sort (0:48 to 2:40). In this activity, we will be using an external JavaScript file to contain our logic and the browser's inspector console to view our outputs. Our HTML page should be as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 < html > < head > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /> < title > JavaScript Bubble Sort </ title > </ head > < body > <!-- I'm assuming the JavaScript file is named as follows and is in the same file directory as this HTML file. --> < script src = \"bubbleSort.js\" ></ script > </ body > </ html > Let's start our JavaScript file as follows: const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); Line 2 should print out the array with its elements in the original order. Let's use bubble sort to reorder the elements in this array in ascending order. Below the given JavaScript code snippet, declare a variable called is_sorted . This variable will serve as a flag variable that will determine whether to continue running through another iteration of the bubble sort algorithm. Our implementation of the bubble sort algorithm will be encapsulated within a do-while loop like as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Using a do-while loop makes it such that we won't require is_sorted to be initialized with a value just yet. Upon completing all the necessary rounds with the bubble sort algorithm, we will print out the sorted array. An alternative to using the do-while loop in this case is a for/of loop. Within the do-while loop, we will implement another loop structure - this time, we will be using a for loop. const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length ; ++ j ) { // we start comparing elements in here } } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); The mechanism behind how the bubble sort algorithm works revolves around comparing each element against its neighboring element in the array. In this implementation, we compare to check if each element is smaller than the left neighbor. At the end of each iteration, the largest element \"bubbles\" up to the end of the unsorted portion of the array (hence, why it's called bubble sort). const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ do { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } } while ( is_sorted ); console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); And voila, we basically created a simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. We can make a few changes to make this algorithm perform more efficiently though (in data structures and algorithms courses, the idea is to produce efficient algorithms or structures that utilize as little computer resources and/or time as possible). Modifications for Efficiency Here the do-while loop makes it such that the whole algorithm keeps iterating over the whole array to see if it is sorted. However, we have established that after each iteration, every last element in the unsorted portion of the array is considered as sorted. Therefore, we do not need each iteration to loop through to check against the sorted portion of the array. We can do this by replacing the do-while loop with another for loop with another iterator variable. After that, we can deduct the value of that iterator variable from array.length in the inner for loop (i.e., array_length - i ). In this implementation, the first iteration checks the whole array since array_length - 0 . In each subsequent iteration, i is incremented by 1, and the range checked in the inner for loop shrinks by size 1 (i.e., array_length - 1 in iteration #2, array_length - 2 in iteration #3, and so on). const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ for ( let i = 0 ; i < array . length ; ++ i ) { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length - i ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } } console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); We can also make the algorithm work such that it only proceeds if there was a swap during that iteration (i.e., is_sorted has turned false). If is_sorted remains true after that iteration, it should indicate that there is nothing else to sort in the array and it is safe to leave the array be. We do this by adding an if statement at the end of the outer for loop which breaks through that loop if is_sorted has remained true. const array = [ 10 , - 3 , 55 , - 10 , - 24 , 54 , 0 , - 21 , 8 ]; console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ for ( let i = 0 ; i < array . length ; ++ i ) { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length - i ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } if ( is_sorted ) { break ; } } console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Randomized Array So far, we've only tested this algorithm on one type of array. We can test this using different arrays to see if it works. Here, we will implement an array of 10 randomized integers between -100 and 100. We start with an empty array and we utilize a for loop to iterate over a set number of times (i.e., ARRAY_SIZE ) to push integers of the aforementioned range. If you would like to try with a larger array size, simply modify the value of ARRAY_SIZE , but be sure to only place in positive integers or this will not work. const ARRAY_SIZE = 10 ; const array = []; for ( let i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_SIZE ; ++ i ) { array . push ( Math . floor ( Math . random () * 201 - 100 )); } console . log ( `Unsorted array:` , array ); let is_sorted ; /** * the bubble sort algorithm will continue running * as long as is_sorted is true AFTER each iteration */ for ( let i = 0 ; i < array . length ; ++ i ) { // we start every iteration of the algorithm by making is_sorted true is_sorted = true ; for ( let j = 0 ; j < array . length - i ; ++ j ) { /** * checks if element (i.e., array[j]) * is smaller than the left neighbor (i.e., array[j - 1]) * * if so, flag is_sorted as false * and swap the element with its neighbor */ if ( array [ j ] < array [ j - 1 ]) { is_sorted = false ; const temp = array [ j ]; array [ j ] = array [ j - 1 ]; array [ j - 1 ] = temp ; } } if ( is_sorted ) { break ; } } console . log ( `Sorted array:` , array ); Math.random() produces a decimal value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (not inclusive). We need to expand this range to cater for all values between -100 and 100 (both inclusive), which totals up to 201 (100 -(-100) + 1). Therefore, we multiply Math.random() by 201, i.e., Math.random() * 201 . This, however, produces numbers between 0 (inclusive) and 201 (exclusive). To shift the range to be between -100 (inclusive) and 101 (exclusive), we deduct that product by 100 (i.e., Math.random() * 201 - 100 ). Still, do note that Math.random() produces decimal values, and Math.random() * 201 - 100 will give any decimal value between -100 and 100 (both inclusive). We use the Math.floor() function to take the floor boundary of the generated value in order to produce that integer. Note that we do not take the ceiling boundary of the generated value (i.e., Math.ceiling() ), as this will give values between -99 and 101 (both inclusive) instead. We also do not use regular rounding off of those decimal values (i.e., Math.round() ), as this gives values between -100 and 101 (both inclusive).","title":"Practical 05: JavaScript Program Control Structure & Arrays"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab05/#practical-05-javascript-program-control-structure-arrays","text":"This practical activity explores program control structures that can be used to implement logic into web sites.","title":"Practical 05: JavaScript Program Control Structure &amp; Arrays"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab05/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab05/#javascript-program-control-structure-syntax","text":"The syntax used is applicable to many other languages, but that is not of our concern at the moment. if-else Statement Syntax (Example): if ( condition1 ) { // actions #1 } else if ( condition2 ) { // actions #2 } else { // actions otherwise } switch Statement Syntax (Example): switch ( variable ) { case 1 : // do something break ; case 2 : // do something case 3 : // do something (will carry on from Case 2 since no break statement exists) break ; default : // do something } for Loop Syntax: for ( init ; condition ; update ) { /* do something here */ } for-of Loop Syntax: for ( let iter of arr ) { /* do something here */ } while Loop Syntax: init ; while ( condition ) { /* do something here */ update ; } do-while Loop Syntax: init ; do { /* do something here */ update ; } while ( condition );","title":"JavaScript Program Control Structure Syntax"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab05/#javascript-arrays","text":"Presently, there are two ways to declare arrays: using the array() function to contain variables using square brackets [] (I very much prefer this method)","title":"JavaScript Arrays"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab05/#tasks","text":"","title":"Tasks"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab05/#task-1","text":"Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following.

Example: arrayFromRange ( 5 , 10 ); // this should return [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] arrayFromRange ( - 10 , - 4 ); // this should return [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4]; After creating the function, add another line of JavaScript code at the very end of the <script> element to invoke the created function. Task 4 Create a HTML file that uses embedded JavaScript to carry out the following. You are required to only use the browser's inspector console to generate outputs. Part 1: Create a function that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two. ( NOTE: If the two numbers are the same, the function should return the same number.) Part 2: Create a function that takes in a circle's radius value and returns the area of the circle with that radius. Task 5 Create a HTML file that uses external JavaScript to carry out the following. Part 1: In the <body> section, create a single paragraph <p> element with an id value \"result\" containing the text: \"The FizzBuzz Test\". Part 2: Add a <script> tag referencing a JavaScript file called fizzbuzz.js . Part 3: Create the fizzbuzz.js JavaScript file. It should contain the following code snippet: function fizzBuzz ( input ) { /* ---- CONTINUE CODE FROM HERE ---- */ } const number = 15 ; // edit this constant value to test fizzBuzz() document . getElementById ( \"result\" ). innerHTML = fizzBuzz ( number ); The last line makes it such that the value obtained from the fizzBuzz() function is appended into the <p> element with id \"result\" . Part 4: Complete the fizzBuzz() function such that it return \"Fizz\" if the number is divisible by 3, and \"Buzz\" if it is divisible by 5. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, fizzBuzz() should return \"FizzBuzz\". If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, fizzBuzz() should return the value stored in the used input parameter. // Examples fizzBuzz ( 3 ); // it should return \"Fizz\" fizzBuzz ( 10 ); // it should return \"Buzz\" fizzBuzz ( 30 ); // it should return \"FizzBuzz\" fizzBuzz ( 31 ); // it should return 31 Note Do NOT use document.write() or console.log() in the function. You are required to use the return statement instead. Part 5: Implement a check to see if input is a number or not. If the input is not a number (e.g. string, Boolean), it should print \"Not a number\". This needs to be checked first before determining its divisibility. // these should return \"Not a number\" fizzBuzz ( \"3\" ); fizzBuzz ( false ); Hint Use the typeof operator to check the variable's type. Task 6 Create a HTML file that uses external JavaScript to carry out the following. You are required to only use the browser's inspector console to generate outputs. Part 1: Create an object named movie which contains the following attributes: title: \"Big Hero 6\" releaseYear: 2014 rating: 7.8 director_1: \"Don Hall\" director_2: \"Chris Williams\" Part 2: Use the for-in loop to iterate through the movie object's attributes, printing them each time.

We can append it to index.php by introducing the following on top: <?php require_once \"credentials.php\" ; ?> require_once is a command that appends contents of a HTML or PHP file to wherever it is called. In this case, credentials.php is appended at the beginning of the webpage. There are other variants of this command: include_once is the same as require_once , but it does not halt the other webpage items from being loaded if the file doesn't exist. include and require are different from include_once and require_once respectively in the sense of how many times they are allowed to be appended to the page. Now that we have our credentials appended at the top, we can now proceed to carry out form validation. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <?php session_start (); require_once \"credentials.php\" ; // flag to indicate whether credentials match (i.e., false) or not (i.e., TRUE) $invalid_login = false ; if ( $_SERVER [ \"REQUEST_METHOD\" ] == \"POST\" ) { // check credentials first if ( $_POST [ \"username\" ] === $username && $_POST [ \"password\" ] === $pw ) { $_SESSION [ \"username\" ] = $_POST [ \"username\" ]; } else $invalid_login = true ; } // var_dump($_SESSION); ?> var_dump is useful if you would like to test if your credential checking is working as intended or not based on your $_POST superglobal variables. Uncomment the var_dump line if you would like to carry out this checking, but its output should not be visible in the end result. We are adding the sessions_start() line on top to introduce session variables if the credentials match. This will be worked on more in the next task, but what's important now is that we create a new session variable called $_SESSION[\"username\"] which will contain the username value entered into the form. As for when the credentials do not match, we have a flag variable named $invalid_login which indicates if the credentials match or not. We will utilize this to display a message in our p#error element in the form to alert users if the credentials do not match. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <form action=\".\" method=\"post\"> <p id=\"error\"> <?php if ( $invalid_login ) : ?> Invalid credentials! <?php endif ; ?> </p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" id=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\" /><br /> <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" /><br /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\" /> <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\" /> </form> The if statement syntax used here is different from that of most languages, but it works especially if you plan on printing large and/or complex lines of HTML. Your page should now display a paragraph containing the alert message like as follows: Now, let's replace the contents inside section#container to display something else if the credentials are correct (and consequently giving the illusion that you're logged in). We will carry this out through utilizing an if-else statement. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 <section id=\"container\"> <?php if ( isset ( $_SESSION [ \"username\" ])) : ?> <h1>Hello, <? = $_SESSION [ \"username\" ]; ?> !</h1> <p id=\"time\"></p> <button id=\"logout\">Log Out</button> <?php else : ?> <h1>Login Page</h1> <form action=\".\" method=\"post\"> <p id=\"error\"> <?php if ( $invalid_login ) : ?> Invalid credentials! <?php endif ; ?> </p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" id=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\"><br> <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\"><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\"> <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\"> </form> <?php endif ; ?> </section> Depending on whether $_SESSION[\"username\"] has been defined or not, either the form or the following gets displayed: Here, when the user is \"logged in\", we now have a greeting on display with the entered username. At the bottom of that greeting line, we also have a log out button. Task 2: Implementing Logout Feature Session variables get carried across multiple webpages, so long as they have the line session_start() on top of the page - this is compulsory. In the end, however, all good things have to come to an end - this also includes logged-in sessions. The logout button included has an onclick attribute which redirects the browser to another page called logout.php . logout.php will contain a simple script to log a user out. The contents of this script are as follows: <?php session_start (); session_unset (); session_destroy (); header ( \"Location: .\" ); ?> The simple logout process works in 3 steps: Start the session with session_start() . Unset all session variables with session_unset() . Destroy the session using session_destroy() . One main reason why session_destroy() does not settle everything without session_unset() is that it only destroys the session, but any session data is still kept around. Think of it as a job not completely done properly in such case. The fourth line (i.e., header(\"Location: .\"); ) redirects the user immediately back to index.php . This can also be achieved if you were to type in header(\"Location: index.php\"); . Using a period punctuation here points to the current directory, and browsers will automatically search for any file named index.php or index.html by default. With this, you will find that you will immediately be sent back to index.php without viewing anything in logout.php .. not that it contains any visual content to be displayed in the browser to begin with. Extra Task: Timeout Modify the web application such that it will log you out upon refreshing the page after 5 minutes of inactivity.","title":"Practical 09: PHP Forms and Sessions"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab09/#practical-09-php-forms-and-sessions","text":"In this practical activity, we will be creating a dummy login system that utilizes sessions.

We will utilize this to display a message in our p#error element in the form to alert users if the credentials do not match. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <form action=\".\" method=\"post\"> <p id=\"error\"> <?php if ( $invalid_login ) : ?> Invalid credentials! <?php endif ; ?> </p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" id=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\" /><br /> <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" /><br /> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\" /> <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\" /> </form> The if statement syntax used here is different from that of most languages, but it works especially if you plan on printing large and/or complex lines of HTML. Your page should now display a paragraph containing the alert message like as follows: Now, let's replace the contents inside section#container to display something else if the credentials are correct (and consequently giving the illusion that you're logged in). We will carry this out through utilizing an if-else statement. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 <section id=\"container\"> <?php if ( isset ( $_SESSION [ \"username\" ])) : ?> <h1>Hello, <? = $_SESSION [ \"username\" ]; ?> !</h1> <p id=\"time\"></p> <button id=\"logout\">Log Out</button> <?php else : ?> <h1>Login Page</h1> <form action=\".\" method=\"post\"> <p id=\"error\"> <?php if ( $invalid_login ) : ?> Invalid credentials! <?php endif ; ?> </p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" id=\"username\" placeholder=\"Username\"><br> <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\"><br> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log In\"> <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\"> </form> <?php endif ; ?> </section> Depending on whether $_SESSION[\"username\"] has been defined or not, either the form or the following gets displayed: Here, when the user is \"logged in\", we now have a greeting on display with the entered username. At the bottom of that greeting line, we also have a log out button.","title":"Task 1: Checking Credentials"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab09/#task-2-implementing-logout-feature","text":"Session variables get carried across multiple webpages, so long as they have the line session_start() on top of the page - this is compulsory. In the end, however, all good things have to come to an end - this also includes logged-in sessions. The logout button included has an onclick attribute which redirects the browser to another page called logout.php . logout.php will contain a simple script to log a user out. The contents of this script are as follows: <?php session_start (); session_unset (); session_destroy (); header ( \"Location: .\" ); ?> The simple logout process works in 3 steps: Start the session with session_start() . Unset all session variables with session_unset() . Destroy the session using session_destroy() . One main reason why session_destroy() does not settle everything without session_unset() is that it only destroys the session, but any session data is still kept around. Think of it as a job not completely done properly in such case. The fourth line (i.e., header(\"Location: .\"); ) redirects the user immediately back to index.php . This can also be achieved if you were to type in header(\"Location: index.php\"); . Using a period punctuation here points to the current directory, and browsers will automatically search for any file named index.php or index.html by default. With this, you will find that you will immediately be sent back to index.php without viewing anything in logout.php .. not that it contains any visual content to be displayed in the browser to begin with.","title":"Task 2: Implementing Logout Feature"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab09/#extra-task-timeout","text":"Modify the web application such that it will log you out upon refreshing the page after 5 minutes of inactivity.","title":"Extra Task: Timeout"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab10/","text":"Practical 10: Understanding MySQL Commands We will go through a small series of exercises to create tables in a MySQL/MariaDB database. For the purpose of this exercise, we will carry out everything in phpMyAdmin, but the SQL scripts can be run on a typical MySQL console. To access phpMyAdmin, type in localhost/phpmyadmin in your web browser's address bar. NOTE For those who installed each component of the LAMP stack individually including the MySQL database, ensure you remember your root user password. Starting Out in phpMyAdmin On the top menu bar, select \"SQL\". You should see an interface like as follows: This will be where we will be typing in our SQL scripts for today's practical exercise. Creating a New Database The basic syntax to create a new database is as follows: CREATE DATABASE < database_name > ; Let's create a database named exercise_db . We will create the database by entering the following script: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ` exercise_db ` ; Note that throughout my demo, I will be using backticks (`) to surround any names given to the database, tables and columns. This is completely optional. Upon running this command, you can only run it once as you can only create a database with a stated name if it already does not exist. The IF NOT EXISTS clause will make it such that the statement can be run multiple times instead of spititng out an error each time, but it also does nothing as a result. Select the \"Go\" button to execute the SQL statement, and a message from the database server should be displayed like as shown below: By now, the database should now be available to use - the database name should appear on the left hand side of the window. DROP DATABASES The opposite act of creating a database is referred as dropping a database. If you wish to drop the database, you have to use the following command script: DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ` exercise_db ` ; The IF EXISTS clause works the same way as how the IF NOT EXISTS clause works for the CREATE TABLE statement - you can only drop a database if it actually exists in the database server. The general syntax for dropping a database is as follows: DROP DATABASE < database_name > ; Create a Table Right now, the database does not have any tables inside of it. Let's create a new table called Student that has the following columns: id: INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, NOT NULL, Primary Key first_name: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL last_name: VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL age: INT(3), NOT NULL email: VARCHAR(255) active: BOOL, NOT NULL, DEFAULT is TRUE(1) Note: INT : integer value (default size 7); VARCHAR(50) : max 50 alphanumeric characters, BOOLEAN : boolean value We set id as our PRIMARY KEY of the table - this is a unique column which distinguishes each record/row from each other. AUTO_INCREMENT is often used with primary key columns so that they need not be defined when entering records. NOT NULL constraint makes a column unable to be empty in any record. The script to create this table is as follows. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ` Student ` ( ` id ` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ` first_name ` VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL , ` last_name ` VARCHAR ( 50 ) NOT NULL , ` age ` INT ( 3 ) NOT NULL , ` email ` VARCHAR ( 255 ), ` active ` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE , PRIMARY KEY ( ` id ` ) ); You can view the database table contents by selecting the table name from the left-hand side menu in the browser window. Multiple Tables in Databases Yes, you are allowed to have multiple tables in your database (unless it's a SQLite database). In fact, there are mechanisms to simplify tables so that they don't require so many columns (i.e., normalization) and/or so that tables are linked together with foreign keys . We will not cover them in this module, but feel free to look up on how they work if you are curious! Dropping Tables Just like dropping databases, you can also drop a table if you want to recreate the table from scratch. DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ` Student ` ; Populating the Database Table Let's populate the table with some data. The following command script adds in one record of data in the database. INSERT INTO ` Student ` ( ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` , ` age ` , ` email ` , ` active ` ) VALUES ( \"Adam\" , \"Burns\" , 18 , \"adam_burns@gmail.com\" , 1 ); After running the given command, you should see the table being populated like as follows: Take note that with id being set to AUTO_INCREMENT , there's no need to specify the id value when adding new records (it will automatically start from 1 by default). However, you are still allowed to put in a custom id value if you so desire. Also, note that the active value is set to TRUE or 1 by default. In this case, you can shorten your SQL command to be like as follows and it should give the same result: INSERT INTO ` Student ` ( ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` , ` age ` , ` email ` ) VALUES ( \"Adam\" , \"Burns\" , 18 , \"adam_burns@gmail.com\" ); Task Populate the table with more records: id first_name last_name age email active 2 Karen Allen 19 karen_allen@outlook.com 1 3 Mark Weiss 24 hello@mweiss.com 0 4 Tyson Russell 16 ask@tyson.com 1 Updating Records in a Table Let's update Mark's record to say that he is now no longer inactive (i.e., active = 1). UPDATE ` Student ` SET ` active ` = 1 WHERE ` id ` = 3 ; Mark's record is indicated with id 3. As mentioned prior, we can make utilize this column to uniquely identify one record from the others. However, this is not restricted to just primary keys or unique columns like id . When feasible, one may also utilize other columns that are not unique to easily modify multiple records at once. Also, you can also have multiple conditions in your SQL script to further specify those columns to consider as well. The table contents should now look like the following: Task Run SQL commands to make the following changes: Adam has recently changed his e-mail to adam@burnings.com . Tyson is no longer an active student. Karen's age is to be updated to 20 instead of 19. Selecting Records from a Table By now, you should see the given SQL command script appear upon selecting the table in phpMyAdmin: SELECT * FROM ` Student ` ; * is representative of \"ALL\". The above syntax simply means to select all available records in Student . You can specify which records/rows to select by adding conditions. The following example will select the row(s) where the id value is equal to 2: SELECT * FROM ` Student ` WHERE ` id ` = 2 ; You can also make comparison conditions too when selecting columns. The following example will select only the first and last names of the row(s) where the age is greater than 21: SELECT ` first_name ` , ` last_name ` FROM ` Student ` WHERE ` age ` > 21 ; Task Populate the Student table with 4 more records. Select all students whose age is not greater than 20. Select all active students, displaying only the first_name , last_name , and email . Deleting Records from a Table Deleting records works the same as updating and selecting records - you can utilize IDs as indicators of which record(s) to delete. For example, if we want to delete Tyson's record, we can use the following command script: DELETE FROM ` Student ` WHERE ` id ` = 4 ; # Tyson ' s record id value is 4 The same rules for selecting which type of records based on what column(s) to update also apply to what column(s) to delete. Note about id Progression Now that we've deleted Tyson's record, if you are to add another record after, the id will not reassume as 4, but will continue after the number of the last record instead. Previously occupied id values that were used and deleted will not be used under AUTO_INCREMENT , but can be added manually if not occupied.","title":"Practical 10: Understanding MySQL Commands"},{"location":"archive/202108/lab10/#practical-10-understanding-mysql-commands","text":"We will go through a small series of exercises to create tables in a MySQL/MariaDB database.
