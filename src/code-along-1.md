# PHP Code-Along Series (Part 1)

This practical will be the first of a 3-part series to illustrate how all the concepts taught from the previous sessions can apply into developing functional web applications.
In this part of the series, we will be going through how to connect to the database server, create databases and tables, as well as manipulate data from PHP files.
We will essentially be utilizing MySQL statements within PHP files in a PHP web project.
