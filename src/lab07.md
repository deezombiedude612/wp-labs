# Practical 07: Extra JavaScript Activities

!!! question "The original Practical 7 has moved!"

    _For instructions on installing XAMPP for the upcoming lessons, click [HERE](xampp.md)._

This practical contains two intermediate-level activities that will hopefully help you strengthen your understanding with JavaScript.
Don't worry, these two activities are merely code-alongs; you'll be guided every step of the way from preparations to the end.
Similar to the format of your consequent practical sessions themed after PHP and Databases, you may be asked to prepare beforehand by having a few files on the ready.
These files are not the main focus of the activity, but rather a common starting point can be ensured before starting with the code-along walkthrough.

## Activity 1: Multiplication Table

School teachers are often advised to look for creative methods into their lessons in order to help engage with students better or help students learn concepts easier with different methods.
The multiplication box is one of many creative methods concocted by elementary school math teachers to help students understand multiplication between two-digit numbers (i.e., integer values).

## Activity 2: Mark Demo

This intermediate-level activity will provide a guide as to how you can effectively use program control structures to skillfully loop through the same calculation process with different sets of inputs at a time.
